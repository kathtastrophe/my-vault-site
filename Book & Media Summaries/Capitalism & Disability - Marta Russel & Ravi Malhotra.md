# Capitalism & Disability
## Marta Russell & Ravi Malhotra

The document _Capitalism and Disability_ by Marta Russell and Ravi Malhotra examines disability through the lens of political economy, arguing that capitalism actively creates and oppresses disabled people as part of its exploitative labor system.

### **Key Points:**

1. **Social Model vs. Capitalist Analysis**
    
    - The traditional medical model views disability as an individual problem.
        
    - The social model sees disability as created by societal barriers.
        
    - The authors argue that disability is a product of capitalism, which systematically excludes disabled people from the workforce to maximize profit.
        
2. **Historical Context**
    
    - Under feudalism, disabled people were more integrated into economic life.
        
    - Industrial capitalism devalued bodies that did not fit the ideal worker model, leading to mass exclusion from labor.
        
3. **Exclusion from Work and Poverty**
    
    - Disabled people have higher unemployment and poverty rates.
        
    - Workplaces are designed for "ideal" workers, forcing disabled people into dependency on welfare systems.
        
4. **Eugenics and Social Darwinism**
    
    - Capitalist societies have justified discrimination through pseudoscientific ideas, including forced sterilization and institutionalization of disabled people.
        
5. **Welfare State Contradictions**
    
    - While post-WWII welfare states provided some support, capitalist policies continue to prioritize profit over accessibility and full inclusion.
        

The authors argue that true disability justice requires a challenge to capitalism itself, as reforms within the system only provide limited relief.
