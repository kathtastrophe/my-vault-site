**

Definition of Doppelganger: The word "doppelganger" originates from German, combining "Doppel" (double) with "Gänger" (goer)1. Doppelgangers provoke a feeling of uncanniness, as described by Freud, because what becomes unfamiliar is you1. Doppelgangers can represent our highest aspirations (the eternal soul) or the most repressed and rejected parts of ourselves (the evil twin or shadow self)2.

•

Doppelgangers as Warnings: Doubles have been understood as warnings or harbingers for centuries2. When reality starts doubling, it often signifies something important being ignored or denied, indicating further danger if the warning is not heeded2. This applies to individuals and entire societies divided into warring camps3. Confrontation with one's double should prompt a journey to understand the messages being offered3.

•

Personal and Political Transformation: A doppelganger can be someone who has undergone such a dramatic political and personal transformation that they seem like a doppelganger of their former self4. The forces destabilizing an individual's world may be part of a larger web of forces destabilizing the larger world4....

•

Existential Questions and Identity: Encounters with doppelgangers raise questions about identity: "Am I who I think I am, or am I who others perceive me to be?"6. The idea that two strangers can be indistinguishable highlights the precariousness at the core of identity6. The person we think we are is fundamentally vulnerable to forces outside our control6.

•

Humiliation and Interchangeability: There is inherent humiliation in being confused with someone else, confirming one’s interchangeability7.

•

The Internet and Doubling of the Self: Social media flattens and reduces individuals, making them easier to confuse with others8. People partition, perform, and project aspects of themselves, creating digital doppelgangers8. These digital doubles are created by tech companies using the data we leave behind online9.

•

Personal Branding: Being confused with another person can be an oddly intimate experience, blurring the boundaries between you and your alter-ego10. It can also be proof that you have failed at developing and defending your personal brand11. People cultivate online personas—doubles of their "real" selves—with a balance of sincerity and world-weariness11. The crafting of college admission essays can be a decisive moment when a private sense of self is subsumed by the need to create a consumable, public-facing identity12....

•

Commodification of the Self: Commodifying the self requires a partitioning and internal doubling that is inherently alienating13. There is you, and then there is Brand You14.

•

Shock and Discombobulation: Large-scale shocks can scramble our collective synapses, lead to mass regression, and make humans easy prey for demagogues15. A state of shock occurs when we experience a sudden event for which we lack an adequate explanation15. The pandemic has taken humanity somewhere new, where things are familiar but "off"16.

•

Losing Language: There is normalization of the disassociation between words and reality, ushering in an era of irony and detachment17.

•

The "Mirror World": It is possible to have disagreements about who is in reality and who is in a simulation18.

•

Bannon's Strategy: Steve Bannon identifies issues neglected or betrayed by his opponents19. He is watching the issues we are abandoning, the debates we aren’t having, and the people we are discarding to stitch together a political agenda19....

•

COVID-19 and Individualism: The burden of pandemic response was shifted from the collective to the individual21. Placing so much emphasis on vaccinations and verification apps had social costs, further marginalizing vulnerable populations22.

•

Capitalism: Conspiracy theorists often get the feelings right but the facts wrong23. If no one ever taught you how capitalism works, it’s easy to confuse it with conspiracy23.

•

Interconnectedness: We were not, and never were, self-made; we are made, and unmade, by one another24.

•

Privilege and Discrimination: Laying claim to victim status can raise one's status in neoliberal capitalism25.

•

Nazism and Colonialism: Nazism is not an aberration but the not-so-distant double of enlightenment and modernity26.

•

The Need for Collaboration: Change requires collaboration and coalition, even uncomfortable coalition27. "Everything worthwhile is done with other people"27.

•

Vertigo and the Crumbling World: Vertigo invades when the world we thought we knew no longer holds28.**
