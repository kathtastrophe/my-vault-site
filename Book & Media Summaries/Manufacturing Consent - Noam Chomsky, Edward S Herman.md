## 📝 Summary  
Mass media in democratic societies functions as a propaganda system through structural pressures that subtly shape what gets reported and how.

## 🔍 Key Concepts / Takeaways  
- The media serves as a tool to minimise voices of dissent and to uphold the status quo.
- The filters of this propaganda model are: ownership, advertising, sourcing, flak, and ideology. Even without formal censorship, structural incentives (profit, access, political pressure) lead media to serve elite interests, making the ‘free press’ functionally illusory.
- Publicly funded media outlets should serve as an antidote to the propaganda model, but the unfortunate reality is that press owned by the state is required to serve the needs of the state, not the interests of the public.
- Media pluralism is often an illusion: multiple outlets may appear diverse, but rely on the same sources, frameworks, and assumptions.

## 📌 Notes, Highlights & Quotes  
### Chapter 1 - A Propaganda Model
- We know that the world's wealth is hoarded by a select few, and therefore the media serves as a tool to provide systematic propaganda in order to maintain the status quo.
- The components/filters of the propaganda model are:
	- **Ownership** - Dominant mass media is run for profit, through "concentrated ownership" (e.g. Murdoch)
	- **Advertising** - The majority income source of mass media is earned through advertising
	- **Sourcing** - The media relies heavily on official sources (governments, corporations, PR firms) because they are authoritative, timely, and cost-effective — but this creates dependence and discourages adversarial reporting.
	- **Flak** - The media is criticised through "flak" - powerful groups can punish media that works against the status quo, through lobbying, lawsuits or coordinated public pressure. This deters critical or independent reporting
	- **Anti-communism/Ideology** - Control is enforced through production of a dominant narrative. At the time, this was anti-communism, but we have seen similar narratives pushed, such as the war on terror or corporate globalism.
- These components work in tandem to filter what is important/newsworthy and what is not.
- The top 24 media companies have assets in excess of $1 billion (as of publishing date, 1988).
- Media stocks have great value, and so shareholders have a vested interest in audience sizes and advertising revenue.
- The media isn't regulated, leaving it open to corruption.
- Media giants are often family owned and heritable.

## 🧠 Reflections / Application  
Reflecting on how this applies to UK media, where media outlets can be publicly funded e.g. BBC:
- The BBC depends on political approval to maintain its funding. The governors/directors of the BBC are politically appointed, often with ties to those in power.
- Whilst the BBC isn't funded by advertising, here it's funding is state led. The state is interchangeable with investors, in this instance.
