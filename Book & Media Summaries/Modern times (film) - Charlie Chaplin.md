## 📝 Summary

_Modern Times_ is a satirical silent comedy that follows Chaplin’s iconic Tramp as he struggles to survive in the modern industrialized world. The film critiques the dehumanising effects of mass production, automation, and capitalist systems during the Great Depression.

## 🎬 Key Concepts / Themes

- **Dehumanization by industrial labour**: The opening sequence with the factory assembly line shows the Tramp being reduced to a machine, unable to stop the mechanical motions even after he’s off the job.
- **Capitalism and class struggle**: The film highlights job insecurity, poverty, hunger, and the criminalization of survival (e.g., stealing to eat).
- **Individual vs system**: The Tramp constantly bumps against impersonal institutions—factories, police, hospitals, jails—that control his life.
- **Technology and absurdity**: Inventions like the feeding machine or the endless conveyor belt serve as both physical comedy and criticism of over-mechanized society.
- **Optimism and human connection**: Despite the chaos, the bond between the Tramp and the Gamine (Paulette Goddard) reflects resilience and hope.

## 💬 Quotes & Moments

>The Tramp gets swallowed by the factory machines

This is a metaphor for how capitalism is all consuming, and can literally swallow you up in its drive for constant productivity and growth.

## 🧠 Reflections / Interpretation

Chaplin portrays resistance not through grand revolution but through persistence, kindness, and partnership.
The balance between survival and joy remains deeply relevant.
