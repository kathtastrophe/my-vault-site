# Summary of Notes on Nationalism

As the nearest existing equivalent I have chosen the word ‘ nationalism ’ , but it will be seen in a moment that I am not using it in quite the ordinary sense , if only because the emotion I am speaking about does not always attach itself to what is called a nation – that is , a single race or a geographical area . It can attach itself to a church or a class ,

or it may work in a merely negative sense , against something or other and without the need for any positive object of loyalty .

By ‘ nationalism ’ I mean first of all the habit of assuming that human beings can be classified like insects and that whole blocks of millions or tens of millions of people can be confidently labelled ‘ good ’ or ‘ bad ’ . But secondly – and this is much more important – I mean the habit of identifying oneself with a single nation or other unit , placing it beyond good and evil and recognizing no other duty than that of advancing its interests . Nationalism is not to be confused with patriotism . Both words are normally used in so vague a way that any definition is liable to be challenged , but one

Patriotism is of its nature defensive , both militarily and culturally . Nationalism , on the other hand , is inseparable from the desire for power .

The abiding purpose of every nationalist is to secure more power and more prestige , not for himself but for the nation or other unit in which he has chosen to sink his own individuality .

It does not necessarily mean loyalty to a government or a country , still less to one’s own country , and it is not even strictly necessary that the units in which it deals should actually exist . To name a few obvious examples , Jewry , Islam , Christendom , the Proletariat and the White Race are all of them objects of passionate nationalistic feeling : but their existence can be seriously questioned , and there is no definition of any one of them that would be universally accepted .

A nationalist is one who thinks solely , or mainly , in terms of competitive prestige . He may be a positive or a negative nationalist – that is , he may use his mental energy either in boosting or in denigrating – but at any rate his thoughts always turn on victories , defeats , triumphs and humiliations . He sees history , especially contemporary history , as the endless rise and decline of great power units , and every event that happens seems to him a demonstration that his own side is on the up - grade and some hated rival is on the down - grade .

having picked his side , he persuades himself that it is the strongest , and is able to stick to his belief even when the facts are overwhelmingly against him

having picked his side , he persuades himself that it is the strongest , and is able to stick to his belief even when the facts are overwhelmingly against him... Nationalism is power hunger tempered by self - deception . Every nationalist is capable of the most flagrant dishonesty , but he is also – since he is conscious of serving something bigger than himself – unshakeably certain of being in the right.

jingoism

Jingoism is nationalism in the form of aggressive and proactive foreign policy, such as a country's advocacy for the use of threats or actual force

Obsession . As nearly as possible , no nationalist ever thinks , talks , or writes about anything except the superiority of his own power unit . It is difficult if not impossible for any nationalist to conceal his allegiance .

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 8 · Location 93

If the chosen unit is an actual country , such as Ireland or India , he will generally claim superiority for it not only in military power and political virtue , but in art , literature , sport , structure of the language , the physical beauty of the inhabitants , and perhaps even in climate , scenery and cooking .

Nomenclature plays a very important part in nationalist thought .

among English - speakers this struggle reappears in subtler form as a struggle between dialects . Anglophobe Americans will refuse to use a slang phrase if they know it to be of British origin , and the conflict between Latinizers and Germanizers often has nationalist motives behind it . Scottish nationalists insist on the superiority of Lowland Scots , and Socialists whose nationalism takes the form of class hatred tirade against the B.B.C . accent and even the broad

Instability . The intensity with which they are held does not prevent nationalist loyalties from being transferable . To begin with , as I have pointed out already , they can be and often are fastened upon some foreign country .

great national leaders , or the founders of nationalist movements , do not even belong to the country they have glorified . Sometimes they are outright foreigners , or more often they come from peripheral areas where nationality is doubtful . Examples are Stalin , Hitler , Napoleon , de Valera , Disraeli , Poincaré , Beaverbrook .

Indifference to Reality . All nationalists have the power of not seeing resemblances between similar sets of facts . A British Tory will defend self - determination in Europe and oppose it in India with no feeling of inconsistency .

become morally neutral or even meritorious when it is felt that they were done in the ‘ right ’ cause .
