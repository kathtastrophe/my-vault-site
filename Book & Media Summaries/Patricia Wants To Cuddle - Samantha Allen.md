## 📝 Summary  
A sci-fi horror parodying the reality show "the Bachelor" through an LGBTQ+ lens.

The contestants of the show "The Catch" are taken to a remote island that was once a popular tourist destination - until a young girl went missing there years ago. One of the contestants, Amanda, goes missing and the others search for her, only to encounter her killer - a female, Amazonian ape like figure called Patricia.

**Race**
The only contestant who survives the encounter with Patricia is Renee, the only black contestant. Renee is largely disregarded throughout the novel by the other characters, denoting the framing of race within reality TV and the wider world. For example, when the Catch tells Renee that he intends to take her to the final to complete a racial milestone (the first ever black contestant in the final), Renee is both compliant and offended, recognising the tokenism at play.

**LGBTQ+**
Renee survives through her protection of Patricia - not by fighting her, but by accepting her. She doesn't see her as a monster but as a "*vision of life differently ordered*" (page 211). The horror can't be defeated by violence, but through solidarity - all of the women who survive their encounters with Patricia are gay, including Renee. In this way, the book becomes about seeing and valuing differences, especially in women.

## 🔍 Key Concepts / Takeaways  

**LGBTQ+ Identity & Solidarity**  
Patricia becomes a metaphor for queer difference - she's feared, hidden and misunderstood, yet she embodies community, power and care in a world that is built to supress these feelings. The women who survive are those who identify with her differences.

**Race & Invisibility**  
Renee’s arc critiques how Black women are tokenised in media. She seems unimportant even to the reader at first, echoing how the other characters treat her. But her empathy and refusal to play the game ultimately allow her to “win” in the most meaningful way (keeping her life). Her invisibility becomes a form of protection.

**Ethics, Reality & Capitalism**  
The book critiques the artificiality of reality TV—and the broader systems that reward performance over authenticity. All the contestants know the show is fake, yet they still play along, making morally murky choices in pursuit of fame or opportunity. This includes:

- Vanessa’s deliberate provocation for screen time   
- Lilah-Mae’s abortion
- Casey’s manipulations as a producer
- Renee herself, performing aloofness as a form of self-protection

These characters are both trapped and complicit—making it hard to distinguish between good and bad.

**Disposability & Interchangeability**  
People are treated as replaceable—especially those behind the scenes. Casey brushes off Mike the cameraman when he reports something strange in the woods. No one really cares about the truth; only the story. Romantic connections are mostly transactional. The one exception is Renee’s quiet feelings toward Amanda - we never learn if these feelings are requited, and it seems inconsequential. Likewise, the letters between Kathy and Margaret suggest a kind of love that transcends the show, the spectacle, and even death.

## 🧠 Reflections / Application 

**Not like other girls**
The women are often pitted against eachother needlessly, which reflects the nature of both reality and reality television. But the only surviving character is Renee, which generally signifies moral goodness within the context of horror. What initially felt like witty commentary on societal expectations of women became a message of "social media is bad", which isn't a particularly interesting comment.

The novel seems to justify the brutal deaths of multiple women on the basis of perceived stupidity, when they are really performing the roles that we expect of them. How can Renee be morally superior to the other contestants and deride the nature of her show, when she is herself a contestant, and therefore compliant?
