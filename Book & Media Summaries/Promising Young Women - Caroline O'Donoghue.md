# Promising Young Women


_Promising Young Women_ by Caroline O’Donoghue is a dark and gripping contemporary novel that explores power dynamics, workplace toxicity, and the emotional toll of an affair with an older, married man.

The story follows Jane Peters, a 26-year-old copywriter in a London advertising agency. She is smart and ambitious but stuck in an unfulfilling job and dealing with the fallout of a recent breakup. When she begins an affair with her much older, married boss, Clem, she initially believes she has control over the situation. However, as the relationship progresses, Jane finds herself manipulated and increasingly isolated.

As her professional and personal lives unravel, Jane begins to lose her sense of reality, questioning both her choices and how much agency she truly has. The novel sharply critiques workplace misogyny, power imbalances, and the way women’s ambition is often weaponized against them.

Blending psychological thriller elements with a deeply feminist perspective, _Promising Young Women_ is a haunting and thought-provoking novel about the price women pay for seeking success and love in a world that is stacked against them.

I’ve seen women let slip their children’s names and then cover their hands over their mouths immediately, as if trying to grab the words and stuff them back in. When you ask them what they did at the weekend, they lower their voice to just above a whisper, as if they are secret junkies: ‘You know, mum stuff.’

Part of me has always believed that once it has all worked out for you – once you have the kids and the house and the man who really loves you – then you would be done. You would have used up your lifetime allotment of wants and needs, and the rest of your life would be spent coasting on your own happiness, or dealing with small, workable, domestic struggles.

Can you imagine what it’s like to be reading the same shit, day in, day out for years, and then meeting someone who is seeing it for the first time? Who is excited by it?

Like going back in time and showing someone an iPhone, except instead of an iPhone, it’s their entire personality.
