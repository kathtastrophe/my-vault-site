## 🔍 Key Concepts / Takeaways

**Trauma and abandonment**  
Francis reflects on her relationship with her parents - abandoned by her mother and constantly daydreaming about reuniting, and blaming her father for emotional absence. As the novel progresses, she realises that she has internalised this abandonment and is unable to truly commit to anything, just like her parents. In finding the likeness between them she is able to forgive, and move on from her traumas.

**Love as transaction and power**  
Frances's treatment of Elaine echoes Adrienne's treatment of Frances. Frances is aware of this throughout the novel but is unable to exit this dynamic as she needs Elaine - financially, and needing to be loved.

**Romanticising the past**  
Frances never seems to truly recognise the toxicity of her relationship with Adrienne, illustrating how nostalgia can skew reality. She eventually grieves Adrienne and forgives her indiscretions.

## 📌 Notes, Highlights & Quotes

> *This was the constant quandary of true British weather—in any season, on any day, at any moment—but instead there existed a state of befuddlement and tardiness, forever caught offguard by whatever happened next, as if weather had never happened before.*
> 	Page 7

> *Some secrets become so normal in ourselves it does not occur to us to share them.*
> 	Page 12

We can normalise stress to a point where it no longer seems remarkable or worthy of comment.

> *She did not drink to quench a physical craving but to quell the edginess, the vividness, the feeling she’d always had that she couldn’t cope.*
> 	Page 12

> *Eyes wide open in adulthood, it seemed her senses were too sensitive; sights and sounds startled her, the very essence of being human seemed to be just too much, too raw. It was as if she were missing some protective layer of epidermis everyone else seemed to have been born with.*
> 	Page 13

> *Consent not so much volunteered as exhaustedly submitted, as a bargain, in exchange for a bit of peace.*
> 	Page 38

> *She had options, and options always give the illusion of power.*
> 	Page 52

>*They say love and hate are close together but they are also absolutes, in opposition, and when you are consumed by one, you cannot even entertain the other.*
>	Page 79

>*In fact, so riddled was she with this notion of abandonment, and so dearly she clung to being the victim, it was difficult for her to know what was real and what was not, because the truth was not important or relevant.*
>	Page 86

>*She had the luxury of being able to be good, rather than financially forced, like most were, to be a bit evil. People couldn’t all afford to live by the morals they believed in.*
>	Page 112

> *She remembered a poem she had read at school....
> Trying to be good has become the mission of my life,
> but I’m moving mainly map-less, and I can barely drive.
> No. Fucking. Sightseeing.
> Just show me the way;
> I’m sure if I could find the gear I’d get there in a day.
> But the damn car keeps stalling,
> and I find that I am driving into some place uninvited, saying,
> “Oooh, this looks exciting…”*

N.B. Cannot find the original source of this poem - possibly written by Dawn for the novel. I really like it though.

>*nothing happened, nothing at all. Except, of course, the main door swinging slowly closed on the breeze that wasn’t there, followed by a thousand-decibel thud and echo as it shut, trapping her in the dim vacancy of her half-assed prayer. She sat a moment in this so-obvious sign, decided she didn’t want it, apologised to the universe in general, and got up and ran to the door.*
>	Page 183

We ignore signs, choosing flight over uncertainty.

> *You aren’t who you think you are, remember that. None of us are. You aren’t the labels and terms and ideas you have about yourself.*
> 	Page 210

>*“The more you cling to pain, anger, resentment, the more you tell yourself who you think you are, the harder it is to be yourself, a loving and compassionate human.. Sometimes we are so deeply fractured—not on the surface, perhaps, but like the veined scars of an earthquake splintered through us, down, down, down— all it takes is the gentleness of touch and voice to make us temporarily feel cemented again; a close approximation to affection and we can absorb all the solace as if it were love.”*
>	Page 211

> *This is the problem when a person makes everyone feel special; it means none of them are.*
> 	Page 234

## 🧠 Reflections / Application

- I empathised with Frances' paralysis and desire to flee her problems. There can be a fear in making the wrong choice, committing to a path - it often does feel easier to not make a choice at all rather than move forward into uncertainty.
- The GP's advice of forgiving yourself, not seeking perfection, also stayed with me: moving on from past trauma through forgiving yourself.
