## 📝 Summary  

Capitalism has been undermined not by external forces but by capital itself, through its transformation into **"cloud capital."** This shift was driven by the **privatisation of the internet by Big Tech** (in the US and China) and **government responses to the 2008 financial crisis**. The core structures of capitalism—**markets and profits**—have been replaced by **digital platforms** acting as **feudal fiefdoms** and by **cloud rent**, a modern form of rent extracted for access rather than production. Power has shifted away from traditional industrial capitalists to **platform owners**, while ordinary people have been **reduced to digital serfs**, providing unpaid labour and data. Recognising this transformation as **technofeudalism** clarifies many of today's political and economic contradictions.

## 🔍 Key Concepts / Takeaways  
We are no longer living in capitalism — we’ve transitioned into **technofeudalism**, a new economic system where Big Tech platforms function like **digital lords**, and the rest of us are **serfs** on their land.

### Preface
>the thing that has killed capitalism is … capital itself.
>	Location 252

>What caused this to happen? Two main developments: the privatisation of the internet by America’s and China’s Big Tech. And the manner in which Western governments and central banks responded to the 2008 great financial crisis.
>	Location 254

>capital’s mutation into what I call cloud capital has demolished capitalism’s two pillars: markets and profits.
>	Location 262

>Markets, the medium of capitalism, have been replaced by digital trading platforms which look like, but are not, markets, and are better understood as fiefdoms.
>	Location 266

>And profit, the engine of capitalism, has been replaced with its feudal predecessor: rent. Specifically, it is a form of rent that must be paid for access to those platforms and to the cloud more broadly. I call it cloud rent.
>	Location 267

>As a result, real power today resides not with the owners of traditional capital, such as machinery, buildings, railway and phone networks, industrial robots. They continue to extract profits from workers, from waged labour, but they are not in charge as they once were.
>	Location 268

>As for the rest of us, we have returned to our former status as serfs, contributing to the wealth and power of the new ruling class with our unpaid labour

### 2: Capitalism’s Metamorphoses

>Efficiently manufacturing things that people craved was no longer enough. Capitalism now involved the skilful manufacture of desire.
>	Location 619

> Having assimilated every resource, crop and artefact it could, capitalism has since gone on to commodify the airwaves, women’s wombs, art, genotypes, asteroids, even space itself. In the process, the experiential value of all things is reduced to a dollar sum, a commercial asset, a tradable contract.
> 	Location 627

> If it is to avoid the fate of a school of predators that devours its prey so efficiently that it starves to death, capitalism relies on there being an endless supply of experiential values for its exchange values to trounce and cannibalise. It must always be discovering and commodifying what has so far escaped it.
> 	Location 647

==Under capitalism, everything is commodified including emotions and identity - meaning the concept of capital becomes more and more abstract==.

>Once James Clerk Maxwell had written down the equations linking electrical current to magnetic force, it was only a matter of time before someone like Thomas Edison would turn them into the electricity and telegraph grids that ultimately begat the networked, top-down, mega-corporations we know today – pushing the bakers, butchers and brewers of early capitalism to the sidelines.
>	Location 665

>To produce the rivers of credit necessary to fund the Edisons, the Westinghouses and the Fords of early-twentieth-century capitalism, small banks merged to form large ones and lent either to the industrialists directly or to speculators eager to buy shares in the new corporations.
>	Location 670

>And it led to the emergence of Big Finance, which grew up alongside Big Business in order to lend it monies borrowed effectively from the future: from profits not yet realised but which Big Business promised to deliver.
>	Location 675

==With the emergence of larger corporations, banks converged in order to finance these corporations - leading to the advent of credit.==

>The Victorian belief that firms should be small and powerless, so that competition could perform its magic of keeping entrepreneurs honest, was replaced by the creed that ‘what is good for Big Business is good for America’. The Jazz Age swept restraint away, debt’s dirty name was cleansed in the torrents of anticipated profits, caution was thrown to the winds of credit.
>	Location 678

>For immediately after the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor brought the US into the Second World War, the US government began to emulate … the Soviet one. It told factory owners how much to produce and to what specifications, from aircraft carriers to processed food. It even employed a price czar – the economist John Kenneth Galbraith – whose job, literally, was to decide the price of everything, to fend off inflation, and to ensure a smooth economic transition from wartime to peacetime. It is no exaggeration to say that American capitalism was run according to Soviet planning principles, with the important exception that the networked factories remained under the private ownership of Big Business.

>Profitability remained essential for the army of technicians and influence-wielding employees making up the technostructure. Nevertheless, profit was no longer their top priority. As with all bureaucracies, their primary goal was to keep their underlings employed and busy.

>the programme was not the commodity: it was the attention of the people watching it. By broadcasting the programme for free, they could secure the audience’s attention allowing them then to sell it
>	Location 729

>Drilling new desires into the American consumer could never be enough because there were not enough American middle-class homes to do the necessary consuming. Foreign markets had to be found.
>	Location 749

>The financial project of the Bretton Woods system was bold: to ‘dollarise’ the currencies of Europe and Japan by linking European currencies and the yen to the dollar with fixed exchange rates
>	Location 770

>America’s Global Plan to remake Europe and Japan in the imagine of its technostructure, led to capitalism’s Golden Age. From the war’s end until 1971, America, Europe and Japan enjoyed low unemployment, low inflation, high growth and massively diminished inequality.
>	Location 783

>American hegemony in this era relied on the almighty power of its currency: the only currency everyone wanted even if they never cared to buy anything coming from America.
>	Location 789

>by the late 1960s, the Bretton Woods system was dead in the water. The reason? Three developments which caused America to lose its trade surplus and become a chronically deficit economy. The first was the escalating Vietnam War which forced the US government to spend billions in South East Asia on supplies and services for its military. The second was President Lyndon Johnson’s attempt to make amends for the ill effects of conscription on working-class America, its black communities in particular. His valiant but expensive Great Society programme substantially reduced poverty but, at once, sucked lots of imported goods from Japan and Europe into the United States. Lastly, Japan’s and Germany’s factories surpassed America’s both in terms of quality and efficiency, partly due to the support successive US governments had extended to Japan’s and Germany’s manufacturing sectors – the car industry being an obvious example.

==Bretton Woods - don't really get this==

>In 2002, thirty years after the Nixon Shock, humanity’s total income approximated $ 50 trillion. In the same year, financiers around the world had wagered $ 70 trillion on a variety of bets.
>	Location 811

>By 2007, humanity’s total income had risen from $ 50 to $ 75 trillion – a decent 33 per cent increase over five years. But the sum of bets in the global money market had gone up from $ 70 to $ 750 trillion – a rise in excess of 1000 per cent. That’s when I lost you. Or, more accurately, it is when we agreed that the numbers had gone mad, an arithmetic reflection of capitalism’s hubris.
>	Location 814

>it was only once Bretton Woods had died that bankers, liberated from their New Deal chains, were allowed to bet on the stock exchange, first with other people’s money and, later, with money – effectively conjured from thin air – lent in astronomical sums by the banks to … themselves.
>	Location 821

>Most people think that banks take Jill’s savings and lend them to Jack. That’s not what banks do. When a bank lends Jack money, it does not go into its vault to check it has enough cash to back the loan. If it believes Jack will return the loan, plus the agreed interest, all the bank needs to do is add to Jack’s account the number of dollars it lends him.
>	Location 824

>it is in the nature of banks to accommodate too many Jacks eager to borrow increasing amounts to keep paying each other more and more, while the banks collect huge profits from funding such a giant Ponzi scheme.
>	Location 828

>This practice lulled Western bankers into a false sense of safety: Jack’s loan was no longer their problem. Even if Jack defaulted, his loan had been cut into so many tiny pieces that no single banker would bear the brunt of it. The risk had been shared and dispersed and thus minimised, they believed.
>	Location 838

>To say that the bankers did not see this coming because they were caught up in a whirlwind of unchecked greed is to rephrase the question, not to answer it.
>	Location 846

==Because loans provided by banks were split into tiny pieces and dispersed among the market, banks no longer felt the burden of responsibility in the event of a default.==

>The dollar became the only safe harbour, courtesy of its exorbitant privilege: namely, that if any French, Japanese or Indonesian company, indeed anyone, wanted to import oil, copper, steel or even just space on a freight ship, they had to pay in dollars. The United States was, therefore, the only country in the world whose currency was in demand even by people who did not want to buy anything from it.
>	Location 878

>For Wall Street to exercise fully its magnetic powers over foreign capital, profit margins in the United States had to catch up with profit rates in Germany and Japan. A quick and dirty way to do this was to suppress American wages: cheaper labour makes for lower costs makes for larger margins.
>	Location 888

==Suppressing wages is a quick way for profit margins to increase.==

>It is also no coincidence that union busting became a thing in the 1970s, culminating in Ronald Reagan’s dismissal of every single unionised air traffic controller – a move emulated by Margaret Thatcher in Britain who pulverised whole industries in order to eliminate the trades unions that inhabited them.
>	Location 891

>The final straw came in 1991, with the demise of the Soviet Union. Thereafter Russia and more importantly China voluntarily inducted themselves into globalised capitalism. Two billion low-waged workers entered the Minotaur’s realm. Western wages stagnated further. Profits swelled.

>It is one thing for our dreams to go unfulfilled. It is quite another to sense that our unfulfilled dreams, our frustrated desires, have been manufactured by others.
>	Location 916

>To fill this void, young people felt in their bones the need to break with the established order, to rebel without a well-defined cause, to proclaim their moral outrage at the technostructure’s ways. The May 1968 uprisings, Woodstock, even the fervour with which the young threw themselves into the civil rights campaigns smacked of the rebelliousness that usually foreshadows a fin de siècle; the end of a regime and its replacement with something new.

>Volcker’s own words, from the same Warwick speech, say it all: Balancing the requirements of a stable international system against the desirability of retaining freedom of action for national policy, a number of countries, including the United States, opted for the latter …
>	Location 934

>The controlled disintegration of the old planned system and its replacement with the recalcitrant Minotaur was always going to hurt American workers. After decades of a hard, step-by-agonising-step slog up the socio-economic ladder, they were unceremoniously thrown off it and back to the pit of subsistence wages.
>	Location 942

>As with every systemic transformation that hurts countless people, the cruelties necessary to bring it about had to be bathed in the light of a liberating, redemptive ideology. That’s where neoliberalism came in.
>	Location 948

>neoliberalism delivered the necessary ideological veneer to legitimise the assault on organised labour and to promote the so-called ‘deregulation’ that let Wall Street rip.
>	Location 952

>By the time these derivatives containing other derivatives had come out of the computer, not even the genius financial ‘engineer’ who created them could understand what was in them. Complexity thus became a great excuse not to delve into the derivatives that one bought.
>	Location 965

==The complexity of banking derivatives became an excuse not to examine them; their sustainability and global impact.==

>why did we not let the bankers crash and burn? Why weren’t they held accountable for their absurd debts? For two reasons. First, because the payments system, the simple means of transferring a sum of money from one account to another and on which every transaction relies, is monopolised by the very same bankers who were making the bets.
>	Location 971

>Second, because the financiers’ gambles contained, deep inside, the title deeds to the houses of the majority. A full-scale financial market collapse would, therefore, lead to mass homelessness and a complete breakdown in the social contract.
>	Location 975

>the computer did have an enormous impact on finance. It multiplied the complexity of financial instruments by hiding the ugliness within them. And it allowed for their frantic trading to accelerate almost to the speed of light.
>	Location 988

>As consecutive mutations multiply the variants of an organism until, at some point, a brand-new species appears, so technological change proceeds within a social system until, suddenly, the system has been transformed into something quite distinct, though that doesn’t mean that all of the materials out of which the system is built – capital, labour, money – have necessarily changed.

### 3: Cloud Capital

> Aquaman gets into the car of Bruce Wayne, the man behind the legendary Batman. ‘What’s your superpower again?’ he asks with the impertinence of a superhero brat. ‘I am rich,’ replies Wayne.  
>     Location 1040

> what precisely is it that turns riches into a superpower? At the most primitive level, it is asymmetrical access to scarce resources. Imagine wandering lost in the Sahara Desert, on the verge of dying of thirst. I approach you on a camel laden with flasks of water. Suddenly, I have the power to make you ‘volunteer’ to do things on my behalf.

[[the power dynamics of wealth]]

> More than 3,000 years ago, as you once explained, the Dorians swooped down from the north upon the Greek peninsula. Because they had iron weapons that the Mycenaeans lacked, they took over the good land. Once they had it, they acquired power over those who had lost it. And until fairly recently, it was that precise combination – of land and sophisticated weaponry – that decided who did what to whom; who had power, and who had to obey. This was feudalism.  
>     Location 1048

> The transition from feudalism to capitalism was, in essence, a shift of the power to command from landowners to owners of capital goods. For that to happen, peasants had first to lose autonomous access to common lands.  
>     Location 1087

> That’s why the enclosures in Britain were essential for capitalism’s birth: they denied British labour the opportunities Peel’s workers discovered in Western Australia.  
>     Location 1088

> By restricting access to land, the enclosures helped capital to transcend its original productivity-enhancing role and to grow exponentially in commanding power.  
>     Location 1092

> Before we realise it, the system hiding behind Alexa has acquired substantial powers to curate our reality in order to guide our choices – effectively to command us.  
>     Location 1122

> It means that what begins with us training Alexa to do things on our behalf soon spins out of our control into something that we can neither fathom nor regulate. For once we have trained its algorithm, and fed it data on our habits and desires, Alexa starts training us. How does it do this? It begins with soft nudges to provide it with more information about our whims, which it then tailors into access to videos, texts and music that we appreciate. Once it has won us over in this manner, we become more suggestible to its guidance. In other words, Alexa trains us to train it better. The next step is spookier: having impressed us with its capacity to appeal to our tastes, it proceeds to curate them. This it does by exposing us to images, texts and video experiences that it selects in order subtly to condition our whims. Before long, it is training us to train it to train us to train it to train us … ad infinitum.  
>     Location 1128

> All such tales, movies and TV series feature a so-called singularity: the moment a machine, or a network of machines, achieves consciousness. At that point, it generally takes one long look at us – its creators – and decides we are not fit for purpose, before proceeding to eradicate, enslave or, merely, make us miserable.  
>     Location 1143

> The early internet was a capitalism-free zone. If anything, it seemed like an homage to Soviet Gosplan – the State Planning Committee whose job was to replace the market mechanism: a centrally designed, state-owned, non-commercial network. At the same time, it featured elements of early liberalism, even tributes to what I call ‘anarcho-syndicalism’: a network without hierarchy, it relied on horizontal decision-making and mutual gift exchange, not market exchanges.  
>     Location 1178

[[the early internet]]

> Like Britain’s common lands before the enclosures, they remain free for anyone to use; not unlike Wikipedia, one of the few surviving examples of a commons-based service that takes huge quantities of work to produce and maintain, but which no owner ‘monetises’.  
>     Location 1206

> As with the original Enclosures, some form of fence would be necessary to keep the masses out of such an important resource. In the eighteenth century, it was land that the many were denied access to. In the twenty-first century, it is access to our own identity.  
>     Location 1224

> our digital identity belongs neither to us nor to the state. Strewn across countless privately owned digital realms, it has many owners, none of whom is us:

> resistance is becoming futile except for people ready to turn into modern-day hermits.  
>     Location 1242

> To wire money to a friend, to subscribe to the New York Times, or to buy socks for your granny using a debit card, you now have no option but to give something of yourself in return:

> Then, all of a sudden, came the breakthrough, the real singularity: their algorithms ceased to be passive. They began to behave in ways hitherto associated exclusively with persons. They turned into agents.  
>     Location 1271

> This miracle took three leaps to complete. The first was from simple algorithms to ones that could adapt their objectives in light of the outcome of their activity – in other words, to reprogramme themselves (machine-learning was the technical term). The second leap replaced the standard computer hardware with exotic ‘neural networks’. The third and decisive leap infused neural networks with algorithms capable of ‘reinforcement-learning’.  
>     Location 1273

> Even the people who write these algorithms do not understand it: once the algorithm is in motion, the scale of the data involved and the speed at which it is processed would make it impossible for any human to trace its route through such a vast tree of ever-proliferating decisions, even if they did have full access to a full record of its activity.  
>     Location 1294

> There is nothing new here, however: remember how the financial engineers of the 1990s and 2000s used algorithms to create derivatives of such enormous complexity that they themselves had no way of knowing what was inside those derivatives? Similarly, the engineers coding Alexa-like, cloud-based devices for the purpose of creating automated systems that modify our behaviour are building so much complexity into these systems that they don’t really understand exactly why their systems do what they do.  
>     Location 1298

> But the fact that we know Alexa is not a person is how we come to terms with its intense knowledge of us, which would otherwise be offputtingly creepy or scary. At that precise moment, when we relate to it as if it were a person while we know it is not, we are at our most vulnerable – ready to fall into the trap of thinking of Alexa as our own Pandora-like mechanical serf.  
>     Location 1305

> the key to grasping cloud capital’s special nature, as we shall see, is the way it reproduces itself – and its power to command  
>     Location 1321

> Aided by machines, it was waged workers who produced the stuff that was sold to generate profits, which in turn financed their wages and the production of more machines – that’s how capital accumulated and reproduced. Cloud capital, in contrast, can reproduce itself in ways that involve no waged labour.

> Amazon warehouse workers would recognise themselves instantly in Charlie Chaplin’s Modern Times (1936)  
>     Location 1334

> Big Tech’s workers, in contrast, collect less than 1 per cent of their firms’ revenues. The reason is that paid labour performs only a fraction of the work that Big Tech relies on. Most of the work is performed by billions of people for free.  
>     Location 1386

> So it goes with the billions of us unwittingly producing cloud capital. The fact that we do so voluntarily, happily even, does not detract from the fact that we are unpaid manufacturers

> Capitalism surfaced when owners of capital goods (steam engines, machine tools, spinning jennies, telegraph poles, etc.) acquired the power to command people and nations – powers that far exceeded, for the first time, those of landowners.  
>     Location 1452

> Same with cloud capital. To acquire its even greater powers to command, it too required the prior privatisation of another crucial commons: Internet One.  
>     Location 1454

> Meanwhile, conventional capitalist manufacturers increasingly have no option but to sell their goods at the discretion of the cloudalists, paying them a fee for the privilege, developing a relationship with them no different to that of vassals vis-à-vis their feudal overlords.

### 4: The Rise of the Cloudalists and the Demise of Profit

> So, what had happened? The news, it turns out, was so bad that traders in the City of London had the following realisation: ‘When things are this dismal, the Bank of England panics. And what have panicky central banks been doing since the crash of 2008? They print money and give it to us. And what do we do with all the freshly minted dough from the central bank? We buy shares, sending their price up. And if prices are destined to go up, only a fool would miss out on the action. A wall of printed money is surely on its way to us. Time to buy!’ And buy they did, causing the City of London to defy the gravitational laws of capitalism.  
>     Location 1499

> Conglomerates founded on traditional terrestrial capital, like General Electric and Volkswagen, refused to invest the interest-free central bank money because, when they surveyed the ongoing carnage of the pandemic, they saw the same thing their bankers had seen: masses of little people condemned to low wages, bullshit jobs and diminished prospects – a sea of people unable to afford new, high-value products. So why invest in such stuff? Instead, they would do something riskless, profitable and stress-free: they used it to buy back their own company’s shares – boosting their company’s share price and, along with it, their own bonuses.  
>     Location 1509

> But the technologies that spawned cloud capital have proved more revolutionary than any of their predecessors. Through them, cloud capital has developed capacities that previous types of capital goods never had. It has become at once an attention-holder, a desire-manufacturer, a driver of proletarian labour (of cloud proles), an elicitor of massive free labour (from cloud serfs) and, to boot, the creator of totally privatised digital transaction spaces (cloud fiefs like amazon.com) in which neither buyers nor sellers enjoy any of the options they would in normal markets. 3 As a result, its owners – the cloudalists – have acquired the ability to do that which the Edisons, the Westinghouses and the Fords never could: to turn themselves into a revolutionary class actively displacing the capitalists from the top of society’s pecking order.  
>     Location 1533

> In the process, the cloudalists – some consciously, others unthinkingly – have changed everything that previous varieties of capitalism had taught us to take for granted: the idea of what constitutes a commodity, the ideal of the autonomous individual, the ownership of identity, the propagation of culture, the context of politics, the nature of the state, the texture of geopolitics.  
>     Location 1540

> What was preposterous was that, in addition to saving the failed banks, they bailed out the quasi-criminal bankers responsible for their failure, along with their lethal practices. And far worse, in addition to practising socialism for the bankers, they subjected workers and the middle class to vicious austerity.  
>     Location 1562

> Austerity is not just bad for workers and people in need of state support during tough times, it also murders investment. In any economy, what we spend collectively translates automatically into what we earn collectively. The definition of a recession is when private expenditure is falling. By reducing public expenditure at precisely the same moment, the state accelerates the decline of economy-wide expenditure and thus hastens the rate at which a society’s total income is falling. And if society’s total income is falling, businesses are hardly going to spend money building up capacity when consumers don’t have the money to buy. That’s how austerity slays investment.  
>     Location 1568

> Seeing that the vast majority were likely to be stuck in poverty and precarity for the foreseeable future, Big Business went on history’s deepest and longest investment strike, while spending large sums on things like real estate deals that gentrified neighbourhoods and deepened divides.  
>     Location 1579

> When an activist state makes fabulously wealthier the same bankers whose quasi-criminal activities brought misery to the majority, while they are punished with self-defeating austerity, two new calamities beckon: poisoned politics and permanent stagnation.  
>     Location 1583

> The term ‘inflation’ refers to an increase across the board in the price of most things.  
>     Location 1588

> But in the case of inflation, the price of one thing rises because the price of everything is going up, so everyone needs more dollars, yen or euros in order to buy their loaf of bread or cup of coffee or smartphone, not just the baker. That’s how inflation depletes money’s exchange value.  
>     Location 1590

> under capitalism, money also acquired a distinct market price: the rate of interest you must pay in order to lease a pile of cash for a given period. The price of potatoes drops when there are stockpiled potatoes that no one wants to buy.  
>     Location 1594

> Money’s first nature is that of a commodity that we trade like any other for other commodities. But money, like language, is also a reflection of our relationship to one another. It echoes how we transform matter and shape the world around us. It quantifies our ‘alienated ability’ to do things together, as a collective.  
>     Location 1628

> Poisoned money flowed in torrents but not into serious investments, good-quality jobs, or anything capable of reanimating capitalism’s lost animal spirits. Instead shareholders and executives bought land, empty warehouses, art, Swiss chalets, whole villages in Italy and even islands in Greece, the Caribbean and the Pacific. They collected football clubs, superyachts and, at some point, began to buy digital assets like Bitcoin or something called NFTs that they neither understood nor knew what to do with. This is how socialism for bankers and austerity for the rest of us thwarted capitalism’s dynamism, shoving it into a state of gilded stagnation.

> ‘People on the right of politics believe that hard work aimed at private profit is the surest route to a wealthy and good society. People on the left don’t.’  
>     Location 1645

> The panic of 2008 had killed off the demand for money to be invested, causing an oversupply of money that depressed interest rates. The more interest rates fell, the greater the investors’ conviction that things were so bad it would be madness to invest. And yet, trillions of dollars of central bank money continued to pour into finance, and so the doom-loop continued, with interest rates going further and further south: to zero or below.  
>     Location 1667

> the central bankers faced an ugly dilemma: either switch off the money taps, which would mean blowing up financialised capitalism, having printed all that money to save it; or continue to pump money into the system, hoping for a miracle to intervene but, in reality, facilitating the replacement of profit as capitalism’s motivating power and lubricant. Unsurprisingly, they chose the latter.  
>     Location 1672

> And the key point to note is that the success of such a scheme depends on these looters being able to sell subsidiaries like PropCom at high enough prices once the original company has been destroyed.  
>     Location 1725

> With central bank money replacing profit as the fuel of the economy and with the ‘everything rally’ driving the price of PropCom-like subsidiaries ever upwards, private equity could take over and successfully asset-strip as many capitalist firms as it could lay its hands on all at once.  
>     Location 1732

> Socialism for the financiers gave rise to another cluster of financial uber-lords to rival the cloudalists – three US companies with powers exceeding those of private equity and all terrestrial capitalists put together: BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street. These three firms, the Big Three as they are known in financial circles, effectively own American capitalism.  
>     Location 1734

> The official version is that the Big Three’s founders spotted a gap in the financial markets: ultra-rich people and institutions wanting to be ‘passive investors’; that is, to buy shares without having to choose what they are buying, or even to choose professionals who will choose for them. To service their need for safe, mindless share purchases, the Big Three take the money of the seriously wealthy and buy literally everything – shares, to be precise, in every business listed in the New York Stock Exchange.  
>     Location 1745

> This could not have happened before 2008 because until then the ultra-rich simply did not have access to enough cash with which the Big Three could buy a significant chunk of the New York Stock Exchange. After 2008, however, central bank-sponsored socialism for the ultra-rich created more than enough money.

### 5: What’s in a Word?

> When a word is properly defined,’ Simone Weil wrote in 1937, it helps ‘us to grasp some concrete reality or concrete objective, or method of activity. To clarify thought, to discredit the intrinsically meaningless words, and to define the use of others by precise analysis – to do this, strange though it may appear, might be a way of saving human lives.’

> with the global system we live in today: the word we use to describe it can influence profoundly whether we are more likely to perpetuate and reproduce it or whether we might challenge or even overthrow it.

> To be competitive, Apple’s unwaged third-party developers, mainly partnerships or small capitalist firms, had no choice but to operate via the Apple Store. The price? A 30 per cent ground rent, paid to Apple on all their revenues. Thus a vassal capitalist class grew from the fertile soil of the first cloud fief: the Apple Store.  
>     Location 1927

> The result was a global smartphone industry with two dominant cloudalist corporations, Apple and Google, with the bulk of their wealth being produced by unwaged third-party developers, from whose sales they extracted a fixed cut. This is not profit. It is cloud rent, the digital equivalent of ground rent.

> Today, technofeudalism is deepening pre-existing sources of instability and turning them into new existential threats. Specifically, the Great Inflation and cost-of-living crisis that have followed the recent pandemic cannot be properly understood outside the context of technofeudalism.  
>     Location 2061

> Inflation is never just a monetary phenomenon – just as money is never just a token of exchange value. When, for whatever reason, prices surge across the board, a social power game is afoot in which everyone attempts to suss out their bargaining power. Business managers try to work out how far they can raise prices – if not to profit then, at least, to recoup their own rising costs. Rentiers, both traditional and cloudalist, test the water with rent hikes. Workers assess the extent to which they can push for a pay rise – at least to compensate for the higher bills they must meet. Governments play the game too: do they intervene by using the greater income and VAT tax receipts flowing from the rising prices to assist weaker citizens being crushed by inflation? Or do they subsidise Big Business as it is squeezed by high energy prices? Or do they do nothing much? Until these questions get answered, inflation continues to roll.

> all. If capital dominates labour, inflation ends when workers accept a permanent reduction in their wage share of total income. If government dominates capital, as for example in China, inflation dissipates when capitalists and rentiers acquiesce to a chunk of their loot being used to pay off a portion of the state’s deficits, debts or expenditures.

> On the surface, supermarkets, energy companies and any other conglomerate that is able to inflate prices above its costs will rake in superprofits. 7 However, the less obvious but more interesting repercussion of the Great Inflation, in a world going through its early technofeudalist phase, is subtler and woven into society’s productive fabric: traditional capital is further displaced by new cloud capital, hastening and strengthening technofeudalism’s super-arching reach.

> Possessive individualism has always been detrimental to mental health. Technofeudalism made things infinitely worse when it demolished the fence that used to provide the liberal individual with a refuge from the market. Cloud capital has shattered the individual into fragments of data, an identity comprised of choices as expressed by clicks, which its algorithms are able to manipulate. It has produced individuals who are not so much possessive as possessed, or rather persons incapable of being self-possessed. It has diminished our capacity to focus by co-opting our attention. We have not become weak-willed. No, our focus has been stolen.

> Marx’s own excuse for offering no socialist blueprint was smart: it is beyond the capacities of middle-class intellectuals working in the British Library reading room or chatting in their posh living rooms. Rather, it is the proletariat who, in pursuing their collective interests, should and will create socialism as they go along – or so Marx said. Today, we know from both the Soviet and the Western European experience with social democracy that this was wishful thinking: a bottom-up socialist blueprint has simply not transpired, anywhere.

## 🧠 Reflections / Application  
- Some say he’s just renaming capitalism — Big Tech is still profit-driven.
- Others argue that feudalism isn’t a good metaphor because we still have wage labour and capital accumulation.

Also, I'm not sure how well I understood the nuance of this book. It felt to big for me to grasp fully, and was quite whimsical.
