## Is ADHD a Disability?

So, is ADHD a disability? Technically, yes — it’s classified as such. But if you ask ADHDers this question, you’ll get a range of answers. And I understand why: *disabled* is a complex identity, one that some choose to embrace and others may not. I don’t believe there’s a right answer here; choosing whether to identify as disabled is deeply personal **(1)**.

I have more mixed feelings about a broader trend I’ve noticed: more and more, people are replacing words like “dysfunction” or “deficit” with “difference” to describe ADHD-related challenges.

While I’m not a fan of terms like “dysfunction” or “deficit” either (they carry capitalist undertones, implying that we should “function” according to certain societal standards), I feel conflicted about leaning solely on “difference” as an alternative. Personally, I find words like “disability” or “challenge” a better fit for my experience, capturing the daily personal strain I face. For example, I talk about my “executive functioning challenges” or my “sensory processing disabilities,” which, for me, more accurately reflect the impact these experiences have on my day-to-day life.

For many of the ADHDers I’ve worked with over the years — and for myself — ADHD feels like more than just a difference. When we’re struggling to organize our lives in ways that actually support our goals, struggling to maintain work, or when I find myself huffing and puffing in a stress response after spending half an hour searching for something I misplaced, it’s a reminder that the line between difference and disability isn’t always clear.

## Understanding the Social Model of Disability

This conversation around language reflects a broader shift in disability studies — moving from viewing disability as something inherent to the individual to understanding it as a mismatch between individual needs and a society that doesn’t accommodate those needs. Known as the social model of disability, this approach can be both empowering and refreshing, emphasizing that with the right accommodations, many difficulties can be minimized. **The model suggests that disability arises not from a person’s impairments alone, but from an environment that fails to meet those needs.** The idea of an *ability-environment mismatch* is central here. For instance, research suggests that traits like distractibility in ADHD may have been advantageous in hunter-gatherer societies, where a shorter attention span might have made ADHDers more efficient foragers.

And yet, even imagining myself in those ancient contexts, I know some core challenges would remain: I’d likely still misplace tools, struggle with sequencing tasks, and get lost in daydreams during conversations. There’s no doubt that modern society amplifies ADHD challenges, but a change of environment doesn’t make them disappear entirely. For this reason, while I consider the social disability model my foundation, I also recognize its limitations and the risk it carries of minimizing individual suffering.

## Disability and Identity

One concern I have with the recent shift in some neurodivergent spaces — particularly among those with fewer support needs — from “disability” language to “difference” language, is that it may inadvertently erase the reality of our challenges. While I understand the desire to avoid pathologizing ourselves, the language of disability offers important legal protections and helps validate the lived experience of those who struggle (I also don’t see disability as a pathologized word). To me, disability isn’t a bad word, especially when we hold it within the nuanced perspectives offered by different models of disability. This shift makes me wonder: In the name of being neurodivergent affirming, *are we at risk of minimizing the very real difficulties that the most marginalized in our community face?*

### A Pendulum Swing

Social movements, like pendulums, swing wide — and neurodivergent advocacy is no exception. We’ve seen the narrative shift from tales of tragedy to reframing neurodivergence as a gift, even a superpower **(3)**,  or in some spaces, as an indication that ADHD or Autistic individuals are more highly evolved.

Where is the line between celebrating identity and slipping into something closer to toxic positivity? When does honoring ADHD or Autistic strengths start to feel like pressure? If a young person isn’t the wildly creative ADHDer or the Autistic pattern-finder, does it leave them questioning if they’re somehow “failing” at being who they are?

So, is ADHD a disability, a difference, a disorder? Legally speaking — yes, it’s a disability. But in terms of your personal experience, you get to decide what best captures your lived experience. Ultimately, it’s your identity to define.

**(2)** **Disorder vs. Disability**: In general, the Neurodiversity Paradigm tends to reject the language of "disorder" due to its pathologizing implications, as in "you have a disordered brain," while "disability" is more widely embraced. "Disorder" frames neurodivergent traits as inherently flawed or deficient, implying that something is fundamentally wrong with the individual. In contrast, "disability" acknowledges real-world barriers and mismatches without positioning the neurotype as intrinsically "broken." The neurodiversity framework emphasizes that neurodivergent experiences are valid forms of human diversity, with challenges often arising from an unaccommodating environment rather than a defect within the individual.

Personally, I’m comfortable using "disorder" for certain mental health conditions that I see as situational and or treatable like my OCD, anxiety or depression. However, I avoid "disorder" when referring to my ADHD or autism—my neurology that I view as part of my fundamental wiring.

**(3)** Superpower rhetoric, particularly common in ADHD communities, is often seen as problematic from a disability justice perspective. Disability scholars and advocates argue that framing neurodivergence as a “superpower” can reinforce the notion that one must be exceptional to be valued or accepted. This narrative places pressure on individuals to constantly "perform" or emphasize their strengths, potentially obscuring the real challenges and support needs they may have. Disability theorists also highlight that superpower language can unintentionally uphold ableist standards by suggesting that only those who demonstrate exceptional abilities are deserving of accommodations or respect. In contrast, the disability justice framework advocates for recognizing the inherent worth of all individuals, affirming that everyone — regardless of their abilities — deserves dignity, respect, and support. For these reasons, those deeply engaged in the neurodiversity movement often avoid superpower rhetoric, which tends to be more prevalent among those newer to the community or mainstream narratives about ADHD and autism.
