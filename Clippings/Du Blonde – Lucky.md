I know, I know that I've been wasting all my time  
Thinking 'bout the things I fear  
But if I sucked it up and put it to one side  
I think I might just disappear

I know, I know that I've been drinking that keg dry  
And I can smoke my way to heaven  
I just don't know another way to deal with my custom-brand depression
