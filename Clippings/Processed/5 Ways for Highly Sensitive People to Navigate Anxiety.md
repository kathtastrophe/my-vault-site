Busy days. Political angst. Rising prices. A planner marked up with appointments, schedules, school, work, and all-too-rare vacations. Many times, I have collapsed into bed exhausted but unable to sleep (and we [highly sensitive people (HSPs) need more sleep](https://highlysensitiverefuge.com/highly-sensitive-people-sleep/) than others). A creeping restlessness and anxiety wound their way into my heart, and for years, I didn’t know how to deal with them.

For HSPs, these fluctuations of time and schedule affect us deeply. Moments to rest and reflect and the ability to invest in relationships are high priorities for us. They also take time and quiet. With the noise of the news, social media, and our own schedules, rest and interpersonal relationships take a beating.

## 5 Ways for Highly Sensitive People to Navigate Anxiety

### 1\. Assess where your time is going.

Ask yourself these questions to check your “Yes!”

- What are the three most important priorities of my life right now?

- Does this “yes” fall in line with one or more of my priorities?

- What is the cost of saying “yes”?

- What are the benefits of saying “yes”?

These questions act as a filter in your decision-making process. With greater clarity on your priorities and purpose, you can navigate your schedule with greater ease and confidence. And, as a sensitive person, this will evoke more calm and [peace](https://highlysensitiverefuge.com/8-things-bring-peace-highly-sensitive-people/). 

### 2\. Schedule “white space” — time to just relax and recharge.

When I sit down to plan my week on Sunday, I intentionally schedule white space — which some call [“blank space.”](https://highlysensitiverefuge.com/how-to-create-blank-space-in-life/) In those chunks of time, I choose to [say a hard “No!”](https://highlysensitiverefuge.com/sensitive-person-guide-say-no/) to anything or anyone who would claim it. (This isn;t always easy for HSPs since [we’re such people-pleasers](https://highlysensitiverefuge.com/highly-sensitive-people-not-responsible-for-other-peoples-feelings/)!) Normally, I shoot for a mid-week check-in and a weekend slot. This allows me to have time to recalibrate and recenter. For me, that looks like reading, painting, exercise, or time with my husband. For you, it may be a walk in nature, completing a project, or dinner with friends.

You choose how you spend your white space! Just make it a priority. Take action today by setting aside an hour or two with absolutely no agenda attached to it! Use the time to regroup, recalibrate, rest, recharge, and [restore balance](https://highlysensitiverefuge.com/how-to-restore-balance-as-a-highly-sensitive-person/). I’ve heard it said that if you work with your mind, rest with your hands. If you work with your hands, rest with your mind. Which are you?

And don’t be discouraged if your scheduled white space gets written on! White space also creates a buffer for the unexpected! Life happens, but we can make room for life’s reroutes by scheduling white space. Take a breath, then look at your calendar and try again.

### 3\. Process your pain points.

[As HSPs, we feel and process everything deeply — even at rest](https://highlysensitiverefuge.com/hsp-brains-process-everything-deeply-even-at-rest-study-finds/)! Overwhelmed by the input, we find untangling the root of our pain points quite challenging. This can escalate our anxiety. However, when we can identify and name the root source of our pain, then we can seek help or adjust our lifestyle accordingly.

Here are a couple of tips for learning to process your pain points.

- [**Talk to a therapist**](https://highlysensitiverefuge.com/the-importance-of-going-to-therapy-as-a-highly-sensitive-person/)**/counselor or trusted friend about your circumstances and feelings.** Ask them to help you gain perspective. Why? Clarity is powerful. This allows us to process feelings that do not accurately reflect our reality, and it gives us the grace to respond thoughtfully to difficulty. For example, I tend to minimize my challenges. [At the end of the day, I’m exhausted](https://highlysensitiverefuge.com/exhaustion-highly-sensitive-people/), emotional, and powering through like a champ. My husband, however, knows me well and notices the frenzied activity and barely contained storm beneath it. As we talk through our day after dinner, he points out the hard phone call, unexpected emergency with a child, and the [chronic health issues](https://highlysensitiverefuge.com/9-ways-i-manage-my-chronic-illness-as-a-highly-sensitive-person/) I’ve been dealing with for weeks. In that moment, I can see that my feelings of exhaustion and sadness are based on real circumstances that need acknowledgment. At this point, I gain clarity on why I am anxious and am given a safe space to respond to the pain in my life. Freedom!

- **Identify and list the trigger points in your day.** Do you see a pattern? Often, [our pain stems from a very specific circumstance](https://highlysensitiverefuge.com/highly-sensitive-person-blessing-curse/) outside of us or a particular response from within us. When we locate those patterns and triggers, we can begin to process and handle them in new ways. Although I tend to be very task-driven, [meaningful relationships motivate and reinvigorate my life](https://highlysensitiverefuge.com/deeper-more-meaningful-friendships/). When my family is so overscheduled that we do not have any time for family meals, genuine conversation, or fun together, I find myself getting irritable, resentful, and anxious. Once I identified this trigger point, I adjusted our schedule to create space for relationships to flourish. This benefitted every member of my family. What are your trigger points? Take a week to thoughtfully observe your schedule, your relationships, and most importantly, your responses to each.

### 4\. Find your focus, whatever fortifies your mind and heart.

Have you noticed [how the struggle with anxiety is internal](https://highlysensitiverefuge.com/fighting-anxiety-what-i-learned/)? Our hearts and minds bear the weight of our fears, questions, and uncertainty. Left unchecked long enough, this anxiety begins to affect our bodies, too. With this in mind, one of the best tools my son and I have found for rerouting that internal anxiety is to find our focus.

Finding your focus works for adults, too. When I discover anxiety mounting in my own life, a walk in nature or sitting down to watercolor paint quiets my mind. While the anxiety may not disappear, it is paused and quieted. My heart and mind are fortified, so I can then reevaluate my situation and choose how to move forward. 

How can you find your focus? Take inventory of the activities that stimulate your mind and engage your body. When anxiety mounts, refocus your attention to a hobby or [interest that will bring you joy](https://highlysensitiverefuge.com/things-that-fill-highly-sensitive-people-with-joy/) and relax your body. It can also help if you [H.A.L.T. — ask yourself if you are Hungry, Angry, Lonely, or Tired](https://highlysensitiverefuge.com/halt-hungry-angry-lonely-tired/) and then adjust accordingly. 

### 5\. Lean on your relationships for support.

However, one beautiful gift to an HSP is a person who sees, knows, and loves us. [Hearing my husband’s voice](https://highlysensitiverefuge.com/happy-thriving-marriage-with-a-highly-sensitive-person/) on the phone in the middle of the day is a sweet reminder that life is more than my busy schedule or the anxiety that lurks in the corners.
