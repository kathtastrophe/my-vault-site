When you tally up the current evils of the world, any kind of motivational advice has the flavour of a stale platitude, like an ancient barley sugar that’s been gathering dust in the corner of someone’s handbag for the last 20 years.

The easy answer is to act in opposition to the principles you despise. Solidarity is the antidote to individualism. Generosity is the antidote to selfishness. Love is the antidote to fearmongering. Action is the antidote to despair.

Honestly, I kind of think we’re doomed, but I love this stupid world anyway. In the words of [Mark Leidner](https://thermosmag.wordpress.com/tag/mark-leidner/), “the river is deep, and fast, and it drowns many people, but I still love it. I still love the river, I told her. But I do not love it because it is deep, and fast, and drowns many people. I love it because it runs behind my house, and I have lived above it forever.”

Personally, I think there’s a radical kind of peace to be found in accepting the worst. Nihilism in a major key. I don’t think it makes you a defeatist if you refuse to be defeated by it. My reasons for living remain unchanged. The beauty of the world. The people I love.
