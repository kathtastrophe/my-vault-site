# Highly Sensitive Person - Transcendental Meditation

According to the sources, **Transcendental Meditation** is a specific type of meditation that has been shown to **reduce distressing long-term arousal**. It helps meditators achieve a state of pure consciousness without physical activity, concentration, or effort [1, 2]. This state provides deep rest while keeping the mind alert [2].

Research consistently indicates that Transcendental Meditation effectively decreases cortisol levels in the meditator's blood [2]. Cortisol is a hormone associated with stress, so lower levels suggest reduced stress and arousal. This effect suggests that Transcendental Meditation provides a sense of security and strengthens internal resources, ultimately leading to decreased arousal [2].
