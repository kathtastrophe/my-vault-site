She had taken her two teenage sons on holiday there after one of them had lost a close friend; to ease his loss. Instead, she added her own.

The senseless accident that took her life was one reason why the death of Kirsty MacColl is so shocking. Early deaths in pop music usually come surrounded by caveats; drugs, drink, car accidents and plane crashes are almost occupational hazards for lives lived on the road and often at the edge. This was a 41-year-old mother who long ago put her career second to raising her kids, and who sought a life unwarped by a business she often spoke of contemptuously and which, she declared, 'gets slightly less to do with music every year'.

Surprisingly, given her self-confidence and forthrightness, Kirsty was dogged by stage fright, which she ascribed to 'a bad experience on my first tour. I just thought, why subject yourself to such humiliation?

She accurately summed up her songs as 'happy and melodic but with bitter, twisted lyrics - jolly little numbers with snarling attitudes'

he lent back-up harmonies to The Smiths, Happy Mondays and Simple Minds among others. A natural singer, she had the gift of perfect pitch, and though she declared 'there are worse things in life than being out of tune', she never was.

Back at the start of the 1990s, she also had her own regular spot on an early French and Saunders series. 'I look incredibly pissed off and unhappy on those programmes,' she said later. 'In fact, I was just terrified.' If she had cared to compete a little harder, been able to play the celebrity TV slots with the necessary fake gusto, Kirsty MacColl might have become more of a household name. She, however, clung to her belief that what ultimately mattered was her work. 'I've never been fashionable, which is a definite advantage when it comes to longevity. I've always just concentrated on the quality of the songs,' she told this writer back in 1994, in an interview to promote her Titanic Days album.

MacColl was just what I expected: bright, funny and caustic, with a laugh like a tray of breaking crockery. When I proved less knowledgeable about her new album than she liked, she was quick to put a bluebottle in my ear about it. She was also very charming.

Kirsty also put me straight about my assumption that her musical gifts were some kind of ancestral heritage passed on from her father, Ewan MacColl, the pre-eminent British folk singer of the 1950s and composer of 'Dirty Old Town' and 'The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face' - songs that have become minor institutions in themselves. Not a bit of it, said Kirsty. Everything she knew about folk music she had learnt from The Pogues. Her father had been an almost remote figure whom she saw only at weekends. He had left her mother, the choreographer Jean Newlove, shortly after Kirsty was born, and taken up with his fellow folk singer Peggy Seeger. In any case, Ewan, a politically active Scottish Communist, regarded the pop music Kirsty loved (the Beach Boys, for example) with the contempt of the folk puritan. (It was he, for example, who led the attack on Bob Dylan for his lack of folk purity.)

Kirsty was fiercely righteous about the deal the music business hands to women, especially the idea that having a couple of children meant she had given up the creative ghost: 'I'm constantly asked, "How do you combine a career and a family?" They never ask my husband or Sting that question. It's plain old sexism, really.'

I used to worry about writer's block, but I think this time it was God's way of saying: "You've got nothing to write about, so shut up."

Kirsty, who complained that, 'Radio 1 won't play my singles now I'm over 30',
