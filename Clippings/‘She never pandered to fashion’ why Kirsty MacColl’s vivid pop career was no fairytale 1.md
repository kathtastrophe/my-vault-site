In 1979, a young guitarist and songwriter called Mark Nevin was trying to put together a jokey soul covers band called Gina and the Tonics. A teenage [Kirsty MacColl](https://www.theguardian.com/music/kirsty-maccoll) turned up to the first rehearsal, announced that what they were doing was “a waste of time” and suggested that Nevin should play guitar on some of her own songs. “So,” laughs Nevin, “we ended up in a studio in Islington that smelled so bad that your clothes stank of it for week afterwards, recording her demos.”

“Kirsty was opinionated, she didn’t take any shit,” says her ex-husband, the producer Steve Lillywhite

They Don’t Know, apparently written when she was 16

“Very pop, very Brill Building,” recalls Dave Robinson, co-founder of the esteemed indie label Stiff, who signed her off the back of her demos. “An English person writing teen pop was very unusual, plus she was definitely writing from a female point of view.”

Lillywhite thinks her first hit, the 1981 new wave novelty There’s a Guy Works Down the Chip Shop Swears He’s Elvis, was made “to embarrass” her pop-hating father.

he message for Kirsty’s songs was: ‘Men – you’re all bastards; don’t leave me, I’m just a little girl.’ When she walked on stage, I think all she saw in her mind was loads of people who might reject her, which wasn’t true.

From the outset, MacColl’s career progressed in weird fits and starts. One theory is that she put the music industry’s collective back up by dint of being an opinionated female artist. “She never pandered to fashion about music. She knew what she liked, and she had very good taste,” says Pete Glenister, a frequent collaborator. “She was always deemed difficult, whereas if she’d been a bloke, they’d have just said: ‘Yeah, he knows what he wants.’ That was the real difference. It was amazing how sexist it was, particularly in regard to Kirsty. She would get a record deal and then get dropped just because she had a view.”

Her career ran into problems right away. Incredibly, Stiff couldn’t make a hit out of They Don’t Know: its release was scuppered by a strike at the label’s distributors, while Robinson says MacColl was “reticent about promotion generally”. She decamped to a major label, got a hit with There’s a Guy Works Down the Chip Shop, then watched as her subsequent singles and debut album, Desperate Character, failed to make the charts at all and her second album, the more synth-heavy Real, went unreleased (it appears for the first time on See That Girl).

Then fate intervened. At a hairdresser’s, Robinson’s wife, Rosemary, found herself seated next to the actor and comedian [Tracey Ullman](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tracey-ullman). When Ullman expressed interest in making a record, Rosemary gave her a tape of MacColl’s songs. On the drive home, Ullman claimed she played They Don’t Know “about 50 times”: it was, she said, the kind of song “that makes you tingle and cry”. Ullman’s version went to No 2 in the UK and made the US Top 10, kickstarting what became a wildly successful career in the US.

MacColl’s Lillywhite-produced cover of Billy Bragg’s A New England became her biggest solo hit, reaching No 7 in 1985, but she never followed it up. By the time the video was shot, the couple were married and MacColl was heavily pregnant. Instead of making her own records, she accompanied Lillywhite to the studio. “The 10 years we were together, she must have sung on pretty much everything I produced with the exception of U2: \[that’s\] Talking Heads, the Rolling Stones, the Smiths and Happy Mondays,” says Lillywhite. “When I was working with the Stones, we ended up backstage at Live Aid in Philadelphia with Keith Richards, Ronnie Wood and Bob Dylan. I introduced Kirsty to Dylan and he looked at her and went: ‘Oh my God, your dad hated me.’”

When she did, however, everything appeared to have shifted. On Tropical Brainstorm, MacColl sounded re-energised by a love of Cuban and Brazilian music, applying her customary wit and bite to songs from a perspective that you seldom hear in pop music: that of a middle-aged divorced woman, struggling to navigate dating again on [England 2 Columbia 0](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jul/02/england-2-colombia-0-kirsty-maccoll-song) and Wrong Again, spitting bile at an ex and his new, younger girlfriend on Designer Life, and struggling with the dictats of fashion on In These Shoes? She had a new relationship and even appeared to be enjoying playing live, albeit with some assistance. “Oh, she’d smoke a *lot* of dope backstage,” laughs Nevin. “So she was pretty stoned by the time we went on.”
