## 📌 Notes, Highlights & Quotes  
### Chapter 1
> This is what we might call the 'equation of concern' into which 'mugging' was inserted. It rested on an implied chain of argument: the rate of violent crime was on the increase, a trend encouraged by a 'soft-on-the-criminal' policy in the courts... the only way to deal with this was to revert to traditional 'get tough' policies which were guaranteed to have the required deterring effect on those attracted to violent crime.

The author describes a systematic approach to the narrative of crime reporting, which has been consistently used throughout the timeline of British (and American) media coverage of crime. He then deep dives into statistics (simultaneously exploring the malleability and often incompleteness of statistics) and concludes that none of the above is true.

Because the British media's response to muggings was disproportionate, it could be defined as a moral panic. A moral panic here is defined as:
- A thing that threatens social values
- The media presents this thing through a stylised or stereotypical lens
- Right wing people define the boundaries of morality in the context of the panic
- Experts provide diagnoses and solutions
- Coping mechanisms are created and leaned upon
- The threat then disappears or becomes less prominent
- The moral panic does not necessarily have to be new, just seized upon as immoral/fear inducing

>Labels are important, especially when applied to dramatic public events. They not only place and identify those events; they assign events to a context. Thereafter, the use of the label is likely to mobilise *this whole referential context*, with all its associated meanings and connotations.

Labels both ground events and influence our perception of events through context.

>By the end of the 1960s, then, the term 'mugging' had come to stand as a referential symbol for this whole complex of attitudes and anxieties about the general drift of American society - a cause for concern made more urgent by the rising political conflicts relating to the Vietnam war, and the growth of student militancy and black power.
>	Page 21

Because America had already undergone it's own moral panic surrounding mugging, the British were primed to adopt both the label and the panic, as the label was already connected with fear.

'Mugging' became framed as a consequence of social progression. The narrative implied that society had become too lenient on "criminals" — often those challenging the status quo, such as civil rights activists and protesters — and that crime had risen as a result. While Hall hasn’t yet explicitly stated who benefits, this moral panic appears to function as a form of social control, subjugating these groups and limiting the spread of their ideas within broader society.

> And this process is framed by a more general relationship - a 'special relationship', we have called it - between the United States and Britain, common to the media in many other areas other than that of crime, which supports the passage of the label.
> 	Page 27

British people are primed to accept American narratives due to the social, economic and political links between the two countries.
