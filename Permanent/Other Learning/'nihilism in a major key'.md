# Nihilism in a major key
>*I think there’s a radical kind of peace to be found in accepting the worst. Nihilism in a major key. I don’t think it makes you a defeatist if you refuse to be defeated by it. My reasons for living remain unchanged. The beauty of the world. The people I love.*

Maybe accepting the world for what it is - unfair, hostile, ultimately meaningless - is just accepting reality.

If we accept the world as meaningless, we get to decide what matters. This is a form of power.

By acknowledging the darkness without surrendering to it, we turn nihilism into something active rather than passive - a quiet rebellion.
