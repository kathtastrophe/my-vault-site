# Causes of the orgasm gap in heterosexual relationships


The causes of the orgasm gap are complex and multi-faceted:

#### Biology
- Female sexual response is more complex than male sexual response. Female orgasm can be impacted by factors such as hormonal fluctuations, sensitivity and anatomy.
- If the clitoris isn't directly stimulated, many women will be unable to achieve orgasm. Male pleasure is centred around vaginal penetration, which does not focus on direct clitoral stimulation.

#### Psychological factors
- Women might not always be in tune with the sensations in their body due to stress, distraction, or past trauma.
- Negative self perception and body image can hinder sexual enjoyment.
- Cultural values may result in some women prioritising their partner's need for orgasm over their own.

#### Cultural and social influences
- Societal expectations can place pressure on women to please their partners at the expense of their own sexual satisfaction.
- Unrealistic portrayals of women in media can create false expectations about sexual satisfaction and usually ignore the reality of required direct clitoral stimulation.
- Women who have internalised cultural norms that diminish their entitlement to sexual satisfaction may experience a greater orgasm gap.

#### The myth of the vaginal orgasm
- The outdated belief that vaginal orgasms are superior to clitoral orgasms is still widespread, leading many women to feel sexual inadequacy or failure. This negative thought cycle may perpetuate the orgasm gap.

#### Interoception and attention
- [[Interoception|Interoceptive awareness]] plays a crucial role in female orgasm. Women who struggle to recognise and self report on their internal sexual sensations may find it more difficult to achieve orgasm.
- External distractions can prevent women from focusing on their sexual desire and sensations, reducing the likelihood of orgasm.
- Those who struggle with attention regulation (such as [[ADHD|ADHDers]]) may find it harder to maintain focus on internal bodily sensations, and in turn may find it harder to achieve orgasm.
- Feeling safe and trusting your body is key to achieving orgasm. Feeling disconnected or unsafe within your own body may inhibit sexual pleasure.

#### Relationship factors
- Relationship satisfaction - trust, communication and emotional intimacy - affects sexual satisfaction and orgasm frequency.
- A woman's perception of her own sexual needs and preferences, as well as her ability to express those needs, influences whether or not she experiences orgasm.
- Lack of communication about sexual desires and boundaries will have an impact on orgasm frequency and quality.
