# Doppelgangers in literature

Within literature and mythology, doppelgangers serve as mirrors to reveal truths within the self that are too difficult to face directly.

This could be the embodiment of a person's highest ideals, like the immortal soul. Doppelgangers may also manifest as the "shadow-self" - the repressed, depraved parts of a person that are buried under the surface.

The sudden appearance of doppelgangers in literature often signals a rupture in reality; a warning that something significant and fundamental is being ignored.

The double can be treated as a harbinger of doom, where ignoring or fighting it only leads to destruction. However, the figure of the doppelganger often demands a journey, where the protagonist must reckon with their own hidden truths.

Beyond individuals, entire societies can be "doubled"â€”fractured, polarized, or caught between competing realities. Post-Covid, we appear unable to exit this mirror world.

Literature suggests that when confronted with a double, the only way forward is to engage with what it represents, rather than deny it.
