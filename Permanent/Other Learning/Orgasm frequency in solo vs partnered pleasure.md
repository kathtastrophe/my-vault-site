# Orgasm frequency in solo vs partnered pleasure

Orgasm frequency tends to be higher during solo sexual activity compared to with a partner. This is particularly true of women.

The research suggests that [[the orgasm gap]] may not be due to an inability to achieve orgasm, but rather that achieving orgasm is more difficult and less satisfying for women in partnered contexts.

Some non-monogamous relationships report higher orgasm frequency.

#### Attention regulation
- It's easier to maintain attention and interoceptive awareness during solo sex than it is with a partner.

#### [[Spectatoring]]
- Referring to a woman's focus on their sexual performance rather than focusing internally on her own experience. 

#### Self objectification
- As women are so frequently objectified as sexual objects, this misogyny can be internalised, leading to self objectification. This increases self-consciousness during sex, leading to poorer sexual experiences.

#### Control
- During solo sex, women have complete control over stimulation, allowing them to cater to their own preferences. 

#### Absence of external pressures
- With the removal of pressure to perform, please a partner or conform to expectations, women can focus on their own pleasure without external influence.
