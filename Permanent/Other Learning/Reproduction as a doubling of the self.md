# Reproduction as doubling

Procreation, particularly among the wealthy, could be viewed as it's own type of doubling - creating a **doppelganger of yourself**. Children can be viewed as **brand extensions** of their parents, as seen through online presentation - matching outfits on Instagram or coordinated TikTok dances, for example.

When a child challenges social norms, this can create a crisis for the parent's personal brand. The feat of deviating from social expectations is linked to [[Self esteem|self esteem]] and the fear of judgement from others. This is particularly acute for those engaged in [[Wellness under capitalism|wellness culture]], with the **fascistic ideology** of suboptimal societal groups - if those who don't participate in individualistic wellness practices are considered suboptimal, is their child also suboptimal, disposable?

We see this narrative replicated in those whose children more notably deviate from the norm – such as in children with disabilities or who are [[Autism|neuroatypical]]. The societal stigmas attached to these conditions can cause a great deal of shame to parents, guardians and caregivers – a sort of personal failing.
