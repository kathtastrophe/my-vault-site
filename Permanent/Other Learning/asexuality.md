# Asexuality

Asexuality is a sexual orientation characterised by a lack of sexual attraction to others.

Asexual (or "ace") people may still experience romantic attraction, form relationships and have varying levels of interest in sex for reasons other than attraction.

A lack of sexual attraction towards others doesn't mean that an asexual person doesn't experience sexual desire. This can vary per individual.
