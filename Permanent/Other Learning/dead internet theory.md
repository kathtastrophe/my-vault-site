## What is Dead Internet Theory?

Dead Internet Theory refers to the conspiracy theory purporting that since the late 2010s, a majority portion of online activity is not human, and instead is generated by bots, automation and AI.

This content generation is fabricated in order to manipulate public perceptions, push commercial interests, or simulate engagement - and in an age where engagement is a form of currency, there is a financial incentive to reducing human content online.
