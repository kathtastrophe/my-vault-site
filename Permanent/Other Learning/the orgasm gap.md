# The orgasm gap

> *Our study indicates that the orgasm gap is not necessarily occurring because women cannot achieve orgasm, but rather, our findings demonstrate that orgasm is harder and less satisfying for women in partnered contexts.*
> 	Dixon et al, Interoception awareness and Female Orgasm Frequency and Satisfaction

The orgasm gap refers to the disparity where men more reliably achieve orgasm during sexual activity compared to women.

The term highlights potential injustices related to women's sexual health and sexual experiences.
