# The shame of motherhood

>*I’ve seen women let slip their children’s names and then cover their hands over their mouths immediately, as if trying to grab the words and stuff them back in. When you ask them what they did at the weekend, they lower their voice to just above a whisper, as if they are secret junkies: ‘You know, mum stuff.’*

Women exist within a paradox: they're expected to want to raise children whilst also sustaining a career. The problem is, workplace culture often leaves women unsure whether they should be discussing their families at all - there is a shame attached to it. The expectation is to work as if they don't have children and parent as if they don't have a full time job.

Structural barriers prevent women from finding success within this dual worker-mother role. Women are societally penalised for motherhood - whether though the [[gender pay gap]], or unequal [[cognitive load]] within heteronormative relationships. Women also minimise their contributions in both home and workplace settings.
