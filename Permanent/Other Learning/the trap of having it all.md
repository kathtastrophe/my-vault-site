# The trap of "having it all"
>*I wonder if the best thing about being a woman in the twenty-first century is working yourself so hard that you have to be sent to a gym to feel like a person again. You can work every day and meet the guy and have the baby, and take eight days’ maternity leave, and be a CEO and go to yoga and still be told there’s something wrong with you.*

Women are told there is a formula for success—career, relationship, family—but even following this formula can still lead to feelings of inadequacy, whether externally imposed or internalised.

This struggle becomes an individual burden rather than a systemic issue. [[Wellness under capitalism|The commodification of wellness]] frames self-optimisation as a personal responsibility, shifting focus away from the structural demands of [[Late stage capitalism|capitalism]]. As a result, when women feel overburdened by impossible standards, the answer offered to them is not change, but more consumption.
