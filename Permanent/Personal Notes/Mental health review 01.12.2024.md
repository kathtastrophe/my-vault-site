# Mental health review 01/12
### How?
**How have I felt this week?**
- Very drained, a lot to process.
- I am feeling more positive as the week is ending as I'm starting to get through the worst parts of the processing.
- I am also feeling positive after my catch up with Lesley, where she explained I wouldn't need to return to the office until January.

### What?
**What situations felt draining or challenging?**
- Counselling - identifying [[pathalogical demand avoidance]] through counselling
- Not being able to meet my parents
- Not being able to go to Joe and Emma's - feeling like I let Antony down, and feeling embarrassed about their potential perception of me

### When?
**When did I feel I wasn't able to be myself?**
- In counselling. I found it hard to explain why the exercises she wanted me to try were so stressful. I now realise they make me feel resentful, because it gives me a feeling like I haven't been trying hard enough, when I think I've been trying really hard. I couldn't express myself in the moment because I struggle to think on my feet.
