# Mental health review 08/12
### How?
**How have I felt this week?**
- Very positive.
- I'm celebrating leaving the house and spending time on my own, which feels like a big victory.
- I'm starting to work through some of my unprocessed issues to make sense of myself in the wider context. This feels good, like I'm being strong.

### What?
**What situations felt draining or challenging?**
- The actual leaving of the house was difficult - struggling with anticipation.
- I didn't like the storm and it left me feeling stressed because of the wind on the windows.

### When?
**When did I feel I wasn't able to be myself?**
- I think I have been myself all week. Good job üòÅ
