# Mental health review 17/11

### How?
**How have I felt this week?**
- I've felt anxious and drained this week.
- I have had a bit of positivity from my first counselling session, particularly learning about [[Self acceptance|self acceptance]].

### What?
**What situations felt draining or challenging?**
- Angela messaged me on Friday saying that she'll be returning to the office on Monday. This induced a panic/fear response.
- I've had appointments all over - occupational health, hospital, counselling, doctors, haircut. It's felt good to go and get this stuff done, but it's also been difficult to keep my energy up.
- Antony told me he wouldn't be returning to a salaried job. I felt that I handled this well, but it makes me afraid.

### When?
**When did I feel I wasn't able to be myself?**
- At the hospital appointment, the doctor spoke really quickly and I didn't take in what was actually wrong with my knee. If I were being myself, I would have been more assertive. I would have asked her to slow down, or I would have written it down on my phone.
- At the hairdressers, I did ask her to do whatever she wanted to be fair but I should have been more assertive about the centre parting. She also took off quite a lot of length which I didn't want.
