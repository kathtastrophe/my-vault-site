# Mental health review 17/12
### How?
**How have I felt this week?**
- Quite anxious but lots of positivity too. I feel like I'm getting a handle on the anxiety and it's not as all consuming.
- I have had an episode of demand avoidance.

### What?
**What situations felt draining or challenging?**
- The demand avoidance episode felt horrible (on Brendan's birthday).
- I've struggled with hosting Brendan because there's a lot of intense socialising.
- This has also lead me to think more about Ang, who I would rather stay out of my head.

### When?
**When did I feel I wasn't able to be myself?**
- When Brendan came over, I felt shy. I think probably because he is hard to read because he is likely autistic, it just puts me a bit on edge as a neurotypical person. It'll get easier.
