#  Berry & Oat Crumble

#### **What You’ll Need:**

- 1-2 cups frozen berries
- 2 tbsp sugar (optional, depending on how sweet the berries are)
- **80g butter** (or a mix of butter and spread if you don’t have enough butter)
- **50g porridge oats**
- **100g chopped nuts** (anything you have—almonds, walnuts, hazelnuts—whatever works!)
- **40g brown sugar** (or white if that’s what you have)
- **Pinch of cinnamon** (optional, if you like extra flavour)

#### **Steps:**

1. **Preheat your oven** to **180°C (160°C fan, Gas 4)**.
2. **Prepare the fruit**: Spread your frozen berries evenly in a baking dish. If you want, you can sprinkle the berries with a little sugar to sweeten them up.
3. **Make the crumble topping**:
    - In a bowl, **melt the butter** (or your butter/marge mix).
    - Add the **oats, chopped nuts, sugar**, and a **pinch of cinnamon** (if using). Mix everything together until it's crumbly and well combined.
4. **Assemble the crumble**: Spread the crumble topping evenly over the berries.
5. **Bake** for about **25-30 minutes**, until the top is golden brown and the berries are bubbling up around the edges.
6. **Cool slightly** before serving, and heat your custard separately to pour over when ready to eat.

#### **What to Expect**:

- The oats will crisp up nicely, and the nuts will add a lovely crunch to the topping.
- The frozen berries will turn into a juicy, sweet base that will complement the oats perfectly.
