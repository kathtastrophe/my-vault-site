# COVID mirror world

![[makeup mirror.jpg|200]]


At the start of the pandemic, there was a strong sense of solidarity - empty streets, people clapping for healthcare workers, and a shared belief that we were all in this together. People like me began to dream that the clear streets, home working and sense of community could become the norm as the pandemic eased - a potential solution for large scale problems like climate change, as well as a collective humbling - a sense that we could let go of smaller differences in the face of such extreme anxiety, "all get along". But as time went on, this unity fractured.

The burden of the responsibility was increasingly shifted onto the individual - get your vaccine, wear your mask, keep your distance - rather than systemic solutions. Those without office jobs were denied wages or forced into unsafe working environments, highlighting inequalities that were previously unnoticed.

Narratives were accepted because they fit in with our world views. For example, rejecting theories that were linked with [[the rise of conspiracy politics|conspiracy]] - such as COVID originating from a lab leak - and failing to give them any credence even as they became more and more likely to be based in (at least partial) truth.

Solutions failed to contain the nuance required to tackle such a complex issue, instead being framed as a stark binary: lockdown vs reopening. The division served to deepen the polarisation within social and political circles that was already well underway pre-COVID.
