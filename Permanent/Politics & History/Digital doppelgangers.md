# Digital doppelgangers

![[two mobile phones communicating.gif|200]]

We believe that selfhood is defined by us, accounting for our values and beliefs. But the creation of digital doubles online are often uncanny in themselves - curated versions of ourselves that exist in parallel to our real-world identities.

Algorithms shape our online doubles, rewarding engagement over authenticity and promoting identity as performative rather than an inherent truth. This process is systemic - every data point that we generate fuels an ecosystem that is not only predictive but prescriptive, guiding our actions and perceptions. Perhaps [[The internet as a deity|algorithms act as modern deities]].

Clout then becomes the currency of the online world, reducing human worth to visibility and engagement. The ability to censor others with ease accelerates this drive toward dehumanisation. Ultimately, the curation of our selves online forms our own, uncanny doubles - and the control we have over these counterparts is quickly eroding as algorithms grow.
