# Disability and poverty

>*In this most unequal country, where over decades wealth and income as a share of GDP have been shifting from employees to owners, from wages to capital, why would a Labour government reach for £5bn from a group – disabled people – who, the Resolution Foundation reports, live in households with [44% less income](https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/app/uploads/2023/01/Costly-differences.pdf) than the median? To be disabled at working age is almost always to be poor, living in a poor district. (In Wokingham only [4% of working-age people](https://ifs.org.uk/publications/health-related-benefit-claims-post-pandemic-uk-trends-and-global-context) claim a health-related benefit; in Blackpool, [the figure is 19%](https://ifs.org.uk/publications/health-related-benefit-claims-post-pandemic-uk-trends-and-global-context).)*

Disabled people are much **more likely to live in poverty** than non-disabled people.

Narratives of the lazy disabled person - **deserving vs undeserving poor** - are utilised in order to control the labour force and scapegoat larger socioeconomic issues.
