# Disability under capitalism

**Disability under capitalism is defined in relation to labour**. Non-standard workers struggle to participate in the workforce without substantial accommodations, leading the ruling classes to view them as "lesser" for not directly contributing to capital accumulation.

**The welfare system** provides a morally comforting "out" for capitalists, who can avoid employing non-standard workers, shifting costs onto governments and deepening the economic divide between those who are and are not able to work. *See [[the role of welfare in controlling labour]]*.

We have also seen the **commodification of disablement** in the form of profit-focused rehabilitation and institutionalisation. For example, it's more profitable for a disabled person to be occupying a bed in a care home than integrating them into labour forces.

**The definition of disability isn't static** - it changes based on the needs of capitalism.

> *When the welfare state entered into 'crisis', governments attempted to narrow the definition of disablement and to cut entitlement levels.*
