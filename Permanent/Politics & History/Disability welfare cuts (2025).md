# Disability Welfare Cuts

In March of 2025, the Labour government unveiled plans to cut PIP benefits (or, disability welfare unattached to income) by £5billion.

The government has claimed that the number of people considered "too sick to work" had increased by 383% since the pandemic. However, this fails to account for the previous governments overhaul of the welfare system, to a universal system (Universal Credit). Whilst the number of people claiming PIP has risen, this is closer to 40%.

Here, we see the distortion of facts to create a familiar narrative - the idea that only some disabled people have earned their entitlement to welfare, and that there are vast numbers who are physically able to work. However, it's thought that two thirds of PIP claimants are in the most financially deprived segment of the population.

>*“Reducing Pip is not going to be the incentive they think it’s going to be to get people into work,” Kleanthous said. “What it’s actually going to do is push people more into poverty, rely more on the NHS, and put even more strain on public services that are already at breaking point.”*

## Haven't I heard this before?

The baseless rhetoric of the lazy disabled person draining the state was used during the [[Nazi Euthanasia Program (Aktion T4)]] during WW2. It echoes [[nationalism|nationalistic]] ideas of winners and loses, deserving and undeserving. As these cuts won't affect the non-disabled people, it becomes easy for individuals to create distance from empathy and attach a financial value to the "burden" of disability.
