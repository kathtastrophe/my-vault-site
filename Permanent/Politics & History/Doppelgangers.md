# Definition of Doppelganger

>Uncanny, a feeling Sigmund Freud described as “that species of the frightening that goes back to what was once well known and had long been familiar”—but is suddenly alien. The uncanniness provoked by doppelgangers is particularly acute because the thing that becomes unfamiliar is you.
>	[[Doppelganger - Naomi Klein]] - *Page 10*

A doppelganger is **the external identity of the doubled self**. This may represent your highest aspirations (the eternal soul) or the most repressed and disturbed facets of our selves (the shadow self).
