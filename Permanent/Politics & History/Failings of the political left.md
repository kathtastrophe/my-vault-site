# Failings of the left

Figures like [[Steve Bannon]] will actively court disaffected Democrats. But within the left, we are often fixated on **internal differences** and do not look externally to extend our inclusivity. We have a tendency to write off members of other political parties in broad strokes - that individuals are in some way bigoted, or a conspiracist, and therefore not worth our time and attention. We can be smug and exclusionary.

The modern label of "privileged" complicates the divide -  individuals are reduced to their race or gender, ignoring the broader economic reality of exploitation under capitalism. Those who felt abandoned by the left (typically the white working classes) have been welcomed by the [[the rise of conspiracy politics|mirror world]].

The difference between the left and right in its current state is clear: the left critique capital itself, while the right merely seek to navigate within it, aiming for individual success rather than systemic change.
