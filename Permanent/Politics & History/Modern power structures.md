# Modern power structures

>*The extreme consolidation in the corporate world over the past three decades has produced a playing field so rigged against consumers that pursuing the basics of life can feel like navigating a never-ending series of scams.*

[[Late stage capitalism|Capitalism]] dictates that **wealth and power are equivalent** - large fortunes create systems of control. During COVID, we saw the speed of corporate consolidation grow exponentially - the world's ten richest men [more than doubled their wealth](https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/ten-richest-men-double-their-fortunes-pandemic-while-incomes-99-percent-humanity) during the first two years of the pandemic, widening the divide between the richest and poorest in society. 

These elites have no public mandate, but exert a huge amount of control over global crises - climate change, economic inequality, public health emergencies - acting with impunity despite their role in perpetuating these crises. [[government corruption|The state]] only serves to support these elites.

Modern systems maintain control by **disguising self interest as public service**, creating a world where individuals can recognise that they are being exploited but have no power to change their circumstances. Whilst essential services still exist, these are a mirror-world version of what they once were, with the onus on profit over collective societal care.

[[the rise of conspiracy politics|Conspiracy culture]] thrives in this climate, offering the illusion of power and embattlement and a chance for individuals to regain control.

The rise of monopolistic tech giants, algorithmic control over labour, and the enclosure of digital spaces suggest a shift toward something even more extractive than capitalismâ€”what some call [[Technofeudalism]].
