# Naomi Wolf

![[Wolf gif.gif|200]]

Naomi Wolf was once a prominent progressive feminist (author of The Beauty Myth), but has now found a new role in [[Steve Bannon]]'s sphere of influence, regaining the attention, influence and power she once lost.

She positions herself as a "mom in chief" for disaffected voters - particularly suburban women angered by COVID restrictions, vaccine mandates and passports, and cultural shifts in education and gender discourse.

Wolf has drilled down into anxieties about government overreach and civil liberties to reshape herself as a champion of free speech to her newfound right wing audience.

Wolf's reinvention could be perceived as a copying of her self, a personal doppelganger - and with each narrative she flips, each value she retreats from, who is she then? (*See [[The self, post duplication]]*).
