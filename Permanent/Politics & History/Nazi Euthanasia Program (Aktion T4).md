# Nazi Euthanasia Program

## Summary

The Nazi euthanasia program was known as _Aktion T4_. This refers to a state-run targeting of disabled people for involuntary sterilisation and euthanasia.

This program was based on the ideology of [[eugenics]]. Disabled people were framed as financial drains on the state and "life unworthy of life" (*Lebensunwertes Leben*). Disability was perceived as a threat to the the "purity" of the Aryan race.

This genocide was initially kept secret from the public, although awareness naturally grew as patterns emerged - institutionalised people dying from the same causes, such as pneumonia or heart failure, or ashes returned to families with no explanation of the cause of death.

*Aktion 4* helped to normalise genocide under the Nazi regime, paving the way for the Holocaust and normalising mass murder under the pretence of upholding public health.

## Timeline

The *Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring* was enacted in 1933, leading to the forced sterilisation of 400,000 people with disabilities, mental illnesses, or chronic conditions.

*Aktion T4* followed and was in place from 1939 - 1941. Around 70,000 disabled adults and children were murdered in gas chambers, hospitals, and other facilities under Hitler's authority.

As public backlash grew, the killings became decentralised - starvation, neglect and lethal injections took the place of gas chambers, making these murders more difficult to track.
