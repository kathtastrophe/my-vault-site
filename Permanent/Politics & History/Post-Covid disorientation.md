# Post -Covid disorientation

The post-pandemic world feels familiar, yet uncanny - as if we're all out of sync with each other, and struggling to adjust to a reality that has shifted in ways we don't fully understand.

This disorientation has led many to abandon nuanced thinking in favour of binaries: strong vs weak, awake vs sheep, righteous vs depraved. Where complexity once existed, reactionary group identities now dominate.

We see this confusion reflected in modern political discourse. Deregulated late-stage capitalism creates such vast inequalities that it forces society into a [[The vulnerability of shock|shocked and vulnerable state]], leading to [[the rise of conspiracy politics]].

Instead of groups turning on capitalism as the source of these inequalities, the more comforting narrative is to frame capitalism as *communism in disguise* - something foreign, unknown, proven to fail. Communist governments have been overthrown throughout modern history, so perhaps this lends a sense of agency - if capitalism is in fact communism, we can may be able to return to prosperous capitalism, i.e. the status quo.
