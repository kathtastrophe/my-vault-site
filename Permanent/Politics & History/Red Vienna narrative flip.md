# Red Vienna narrative flip

The great depression (1929) ravaged the global economy, including the economy of Austria and Red Vienna. Red Vienna's social programs relied on strong economic growth and taxation in order to function.

The idea of [[prejudice & scapegoating|scapegoating]] disabled people as [[vilification of disabled people|drains on the state]] therefore became politically useful. Individuals affected by this economic downturn sought answers, and were sold the narrative that welfare was the problem, not the solution, through the extreme use of [[nazi propaganda|propaganda]]. 

ðŸ’¡ *See: [[the cause of ideological shifts]]*.

These sequence of events set the stage for a political shift. In 1934, the socialist government was overthrown by a right wing authoritarian regime. This government viewed society as hierarchical, perceiving "weakness" as a threat.

## What can we learn?

It is often easier to shift blame onto individuals, rather than examining [[Modern power structures|power dynamics]] and [[alternatives to capitalism|system reform]].

If you destroy the institutions upholding a worldview, you make space for an alternative to take root.
