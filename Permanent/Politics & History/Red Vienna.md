# Red Vienna

Red Vienna refers to the period between 1919 - 1934 where Vienna was governed by the Social Democratic Worker's Party. This progressive government enacted progressive policies, supporting the welfare of the working classes, such as:

- High quality **social housing**, with communal spaces like libraries and childcare facilities
- **Universal healthcare**
- Improved **education**
- Support for **autistic and disabled** children, who were seen as different but were not yet excluded from society
- A strong **workers' movement**
- A focus on **arts and culture**, with prominent figures like Sigmund Freud influencing thought

During this period of governance, tensions with right-wing factions grew, leading to the Austrian Civil War (1934) and the downfall of Red Vienna.
