# How Steve Bannon operates

![[Pasted image 20250315143000.png|200]]

Bannon's approach to politics is calculated and deeply strategic. He observes and collects the issues that those on the left neglect, such as economic insecurity, institutional distrust, and cultural anxieties - and repackages them as rallying points for his own political agenda. The left are painted as elitist and exclusionary, with himself as the protector of his audience - offering them validation and a sense of community.

His strategy is to mirror and repurpose the language and tactics of the left - identifying grievances that the left have abandoned, such as the anger over profiteering and elite hypocrisy ([[the Wall Street protests]]) - and weaponizing them to attract new supporters. The language of the left is also picked over, subverted to fit his narratives (*see: [[the disassociation of words from reality]]*), framing his movement as the real victims of oppression and reducing the vocabulary we can draw from to describe the more disturbing elements of our current reality.

The discontent he creates serves to fuel his broader political ambitions. His rhetoric serves to create power for himself, as a true individualist under capitalism.
