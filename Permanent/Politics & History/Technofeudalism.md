# Technofeudalism
**Technofeudalism** is the idea that our [[Modern power structures|modern power structures]] no longer reflect traditional capitalism, but a new kind of [[feudalism|feudal]] system where a few powerful tech monopolists ("cloud capitalists") control vast amounts of data, attention, and infrastructure. Instead of owning land, they own digital spaces and extract value from users’ behaviour, treating people more like serfs than consumers—trading their autonomy and focus for access.

## Criticisms
- Most people still earn money by selling their labour.
- Companies still strive to cut labour costs in order to boost profits.
- Tech companies extract cloud rent, but that rent is turned into capitalist profit.
- Opting out of the internet is becoming increasingly more difficult, but the internet is infrastructure, not a realm. Participation is transactional, not required.
- Markets still rule - Instagram vs TikTok, for example.
