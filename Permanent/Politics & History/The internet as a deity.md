# Is the internet a religion? Is the algorithm the new God?

Religion is, in part, used to control and pacify societies. If a group is at risk of eternal damnation, for example, they may behave in line with expectations in order to avoid this fate.

If God has been historically conceptualised as an omnipotent entity, capable of knowing our thoughts and intentions, then social media, AI and surveillance capitalism serve as modern parallels.

This system does not seek enlightenment - it seeks extraction. We're not just being watched, we're being mined - our data repurposed to reinforce behavioural loops that serve corporate interests. This omnipresence is man made - as is religion.
