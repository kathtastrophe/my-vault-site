# The self, post-duplication

>*And here’s an extra twist: My doppelganger is a person who has undergone such a dramatic political and personal transformation that many have commented that she seems like a doppelganger of her former self. Which, in a way, makes me a double of a double, an uncanny state of affairs even Freud did not anticipate.*
>	Page 10, [[Doppelganger - Naomi Klein]]

A person can become their own doppelganger through the duplication of the self. This occurrence of duplication appears to propel the erosion of integrity and social responsibility.

Self-duplication may therefore carry a cost. If it's replicated multiple times, there may be a risk of further decay of the self, akin to a photocopy degrading with each copy.

I wonder if this theory could be applied to capitalism. Was capitalism always extractive and self-serving, or did it start with a promise of care that was lost through cycles of replication? If self-duplication erodes integrity and responsibility, does capitalism function the same way—becoming emptier and more self-consuming with each iteration?
