# The vulnerability of shock

Large-scale shocks - whether personal or societal - disrupt our collective ability to think clearly. They create a deficit between the events that have happened and how we can explain these events clearly.

When people are disoriented by shock, they become more susceptible to manipulation, making them easy prey for demagogues who offer simplistic, often dangerous, narratives.

**Therefore, shock is not just an emotional response, but a moment of narrative rupture.**

The key to resisting authoritarian control in times of shock is to come together as a collective - to interpret, create meaning, and metabolise what has happened together - rather than allowing the void to be filled by those who seek to impose their own violent stories.
