# Wellness under capitalism
### ...or the commodification of health and The Self

The modern wellness industry relies on individualism to centre the responsibility of "optimisation" onto the consumer.

This modernisation - wellness as a tool of capitalism - was established in the 1980s, where individualism became desired over collectivism. If changing the world (as was sought after in the 60s and 70s) felt impossible, people could at least control their own bodies.

### Your Former Fat Doppelganger

The "fit" self exists in opposition to its former, "unfit" self - the distain for one's former body then becomes externalised, morphing into judgement and hostility toward others who don't fit the same rigid standards. Physical discipline is framed as moral superiority. The "unfit" self becomes a shameful double, one to avoid engaging with at all costs, as the "fit" self is physically superior and socially celebrated.

>*And that is the trouble with this more private kind of doppelganger: when body mania sets in, the fit self may well not be satisfied with crushing its own unfit self; it may look for other targets, its self-hatred seeping out and projecting itself onto other people’s less fit, less conventionally able bodies.*

### Is this Fascism?

The rhetoric of optimisation is particularly insidious - dividing people into categories of strong and weak, clean and unclean, worthy and unworthy - echoing eugenic ideals of natural hierarchies and genetic worthiness.

If a body is "optimised," others, by contrast, are defective—lesser. This logic is perilously close to the dehumanisation that underpins fascist ideology, where the "suboptimal" are seen as disposable.

>*The very idea that humans can and should be “optimized” lends itself to a fascistic worldview— because if your food is extra-clean, it can easily mean other people’s food is extra-dirty. If you are safe because your immune system is strong, it can flip to mean others are unsafe because they are weak. If you are optimized, others are, by definition, suboptimal. Defective. Next door to disposable.*
