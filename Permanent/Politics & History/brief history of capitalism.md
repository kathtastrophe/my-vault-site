# History of capitalism

#### 🏛️ **Proto-Capitalism** (1300s–1500s)
- Rise of merchant trade, banking (e.g., in Venice, Florence).
- Cities grow; feudal ties begin to weaken.
- Markets start to become central to economic life.

#### 🌍 **Early/Commercial Capitalism** (1500s–1700s)
- Age of exploration, colonisation, and global trade.
- Formation of **joint-stock companies** (like the Dutch East India Company).
- **Enclosure Acts** in England push peasants off common land → wage labour.

#### ⚙️ **Industrial Capitalism** (1700s–late 1800s)
- **Industrial Revolution**: factories, mass production, urbanisation.
- Explosive growth in coal, textiles, steel, and railroads.
- **Labour class** emerges; working for wages becomes the norm.

#### 💼 **Corporate/Monopoly Capitalism** (late 1800s–mid-1900s)
- Rise of corporations, trusts, and monopolies (e.g., Edison, Rockefeller).

#### 🌐 **Global/Neoliberal Capitalism** (1970s–2008)
