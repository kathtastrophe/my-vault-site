# Capitalism vs feudalism

**Feudalism** is based on land ownership and obligationâ€”serfs work the land for lords in exchange for protection, with little use of money or markets.

**Capitalism**, by contrast, is driven by profit, where individuals sell their labour for wages, and goods are produced to be sold on open markets.
