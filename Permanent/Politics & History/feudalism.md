# Feudalism
## What is feudalism?
**Feudalism** was the dominant system in medieval Europe. It is structured as follows:

- **Lords** owned land
- **Serfs** (peasants) lived and worked on the land, and had to pay rents to Lords
- In return, serfs received "protection" and a place to live - but they weren't free to leave, or live how they wanted to live
- There was **no market economy** - serfs gave part of their production to Lords, and retained some. Trade existed, but it was usually entirely localised.
- Lords used the production/output from the serfs to maintain their lifestyles - for example, constructing buildings, maintaining households and armies, and showing status (feasts, fancy clothes).
