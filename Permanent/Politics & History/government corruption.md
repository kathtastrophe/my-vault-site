# Government corruption

Governments have become direct enablers for unelected elite powers, welcoming them into the role of the state without seeking input from a public that elected them in the first place.

Donald Trump exemplifies this dynamic, surrounding himself with billionaire allies like Elon Musk and treating public office as an extension of his personal business. This mentality is rife in the UK - our MPs are largely elites themselves, privately educated with vast, inherited fortunes and well connected allies. We have seen a vast transfer of public wealth into private hands with little scrutiny.

This extends all the way down to local government, where fiscal mismanagement and corruption flourish. Croydon Council, for example, has **declared bankruptcy twice**, citing a financial crisis—yet it continues to funnel **millions of pounds** into private consultancy firms while simultaneously cutting essential services like [Access Croydon](https://insidecroydon.com/2025/03/21/no-access-croydon-30-voluntary-groups-demand-reopening/). These consultants do not provide expertise that the council’s existing workforce lacks; their role is simply to **manufacture the illusion of necessity**—a high-cost performance of governance that ultimately serves no one but themselves.

Decisions that strip communities of essential services are spun as necessary sacrifices for long-term stability, while blatant self-enrichment is rebranded as responsible governance. This disconnect between language and action deepens the sense of **the uncanny** in a post-COVID world, where we are constantly told one thing while experiencing another. Policies marketed as “for our protection” or “for the greater good” repeatedly prove to serve only the powerful, leaving the rest of us trapped in a system that no longer even bothers to disguise its contradictions.
