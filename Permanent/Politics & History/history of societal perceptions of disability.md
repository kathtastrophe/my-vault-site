# A brief history

- Disabled people were utilised as **labour under feudalism**.
- The dawn of the industrial revolution saw the **glorification of productivity**, leading to exclusion of non-standard workers.
- This lead to the **justification of societal exclusion**, as disabled people weren't "contributing" to labour.
- The [[eugenics]] movement painted disabled people as genetically inferior, providing the justification for **involuntary euthanasia or sterilization**, as seen in the [[Nazi Euthanasia Program (Aktion T4)]].
- Post WW2, welfare provisions increased, but at the cost of the state attempting to regulate the lives of those claiming welfare. *See [[The Beveridge Report]]*.
