# Competitive Prestige

Nationalists view global events as a **competition**, where their group must always be rising while rivals must be declining. Victory, not truth or ethics, is their priority.

For example, a nationalist might interpret an economic downturn in another country as a win for their nation, even if it has no real impact on their own countryâ€™s success.
