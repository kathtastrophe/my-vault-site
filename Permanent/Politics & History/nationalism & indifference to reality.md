>*All nationalists have the power of not seeing resemblances between similar sets of facts. A British Tory will defend self - determination in Europe and oppose it in India with no feeling of inconsistency.*

Nationalists are resistance to ideas that contradict their beliefs. Facts are either dismissed or distorted in order to lend additional support to their worldview.

For example, if a nationalist believes that a nation is superior, they will rationalise or deny historical events that challenge this belief.
