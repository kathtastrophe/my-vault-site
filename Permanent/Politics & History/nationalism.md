# What is nationalism?
Nationalism refers to an individual's unwavering sense of loyalty to a nation or group, regardless of the moral intentions of that group, and reducing advancement to competing with lesser groups.

>*By ‘ nationalism ’ I mean first of all the habit of assuming that human beings can be classified like insects and that whole blocks of millions or tens of millions of people can be confidently labelled ‘ good ’ or ‘ bad ’ . But secondly – and this is much more important – I mean the habit of identifying oneself with a single nation or other unit , placing it beyond good and evil and recognizing no other duty than that of advancing its interests .*

Orwell denounces nationalism while acknowledging its existence. He criticizes the simplistic and unrealistic notion of classifying individuals as "good" or "bad," yet recognises that this is how narratives are often constructed in order to classify societal groups.
