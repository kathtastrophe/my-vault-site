# Nazi Propaganda

The Nazis immersed those under their regime with extreme propaganda, creating a world so saturated in their messaging that it created a **new version of reality**.

Films, posters, school books and speeches reinforced the following ideas:
- The economy was failing due to "parasitic" groups;
- Those groups were living off the labour and efforts of the "Good Germans";
- Disability was a genetic weakness that would "spread" if not controlled.

> *"This person suffering from hereditary defects costs the community 60,000 RM during his lifetime. Fellow German, that is your money, too."*

Statistics were manipulated to reinforce this narrative - the cost of providing welfare to disabled citizens was grossly overstated, whilst costs associated with war and the wealth accumulation of the elite were ignored.
