# Nazis & Colonialism

The Nazis' extermination policies were not an isolated phenomenon but were deeply connected to the racial violence and exploitation practiced during European colonialism:

>*Auschwitz was the modern industrial application of a policy of extermination on which European world domination had long since rested... when what had been done in the heart of darkness was repeated in the heart of Europe, no one recognized it. No one wished to admit what everyone knew.*
	Lindqvist, S. (1996). Exterminate All the Brutes: One Man's Odyssey into the Heart of Darkness and the Origins of European Genocide.

Nazism may not be an anomaly but a reflection of a darker side of European modernity, where culture, science, and language are not enough to prevent genocide. Instead, it is the unchecked power of a state willing to dehumanize and declare a group as "savage" that allows such atrocities to occur.

The countries that defeated Hitler, including the Allies, avoided confronting the uncomfortable truth that they themselves had influenced Nazi racial policies through their own colonial practices - Hitler himself cited taking inspiration from European colonialism. This denial has helped maintain a sense of innocence about Europeâ€™s role in fostering the conditions for genocide.
