# Patriotism vs Nationalism

>*Patriotism is of its nature defensive, both militarily and culturally. Nationalism, on the other hand, is inseparable from the desire for power.*
>	Page 2 - [[Notes on Nationalism - George Orwell]]

**Patriotism** refers to pride in one's country or state, often expressed in a defensive or cultural sense.

**Nationalism** involves loyalty to a country, state, or power structure (such as the church), but it is driven by a desire for dominance, seeing success in terms of victory rather than morality.
