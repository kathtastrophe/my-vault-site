# Post 2008

Following the [[2008 financial crash]], centralised banks like the Bank of England started printing massive amounts of money through [[quantitative easing]].

However, banks and corporations used this money for:
- **Stock buybacks** - companies buy their own stocks, increasing share prices without having to make any improvements to businesses
- **Speculation** - investors poured money into property, stocks and cryptocurrencies, creating bubbles
- **Hoarding** - banks held onto money instead of lending it, or only lent to large corporations and wealthy individuals.

Instead of capitalism functioning as intended - where investment in business drives production, jobs and economic growth - money instead circulated among the financial elite.

This led to asset inflation (e.g. housing, stock prices and luxury goods) while wages and the real economy stagnated.

>*...The central bankers faced an ugly dilemma: either switch off the money taps, which would mean blowing up financialised capitalism, having printed all that money to save it; or continue to pump money into the system, hoping for a miracle to intervene but, in reality, facilitating the replacement of profit as capitalism’s motivating power and lubricant. Unsurprisingly, they chose the latter.*

Varoufakis argues that this shift means we’re no longer in traditional capitalism, where investment and competition drive growth. Instead, we’re in a form of [[Technofeudalism]], where a small group of tech giants and financial elites control wealth, while most people are left renting access to digital platforms or property rather than owning anything outright.
