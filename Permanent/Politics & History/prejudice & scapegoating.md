# Prejudice, conspiracy & scapegoating


Prejudice generally works by creating a distorted "double" of each member of a villified group - a twisted [[Doppelgangers|doppelganger]] that threatens to consume all who meet the criteria.

## Antisemitism
In Christianity, Jews were cast as the demonic "double" of Christians, reinforcing the animosity that justified centuries of persecution. These deep-seated prejudices laid the foundation for the conspiracy theories that have plagued Jews for over two centuries.

Accusations of Jews controlling the world through secret plots have been a constant, shifting through different forms but always targeting the same group. The contradictions within anti-Jewish conspiracy theories, such as accusing Jews of both being wealthy bankers and radical Marxists, highlight the absurdity and manipulation behind these narratives.

These conspiracy theories deflect attention from real structural problems in society, like the unequal distribution of wealth and power perpetuated by capitalism.

## Modern Scapegoating
Modern populist leaders, like [[Trump]], employ similar divisive tactics, using race and gender-based hatreds to distract from the real issues that affect working people. By channeling anger towards minority groups, they move the scrunity away from the wealthy elite, consolidating their power.
