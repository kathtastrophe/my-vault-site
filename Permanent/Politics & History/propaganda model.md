# Propaganda Model

Proposed by Herman and Chomsky in [[Manufacturing Consent - Noam Chomsky, Edward S Herman|Manufacting Consent]], the propaganda model suggests that the media is shaped by structural forces to serve the interests of the elite. The media operates through a set of filters:

- **Ownership** - mainstream media are owned by large corporations or are part of conglomerates
- **Advertising** - the media is shaped to attract advertisers over informing the public
- **Sourcing** - the media relies on official, state, or corporate sources to inform journalism, limiting dissent and minimising pluralism
- **Flak** - organised pushback punishes dissenting coverage
- **Ideology** - a dominant narrative frames acceptable discourse - e.g. the war on terror, anti-woke, anti-communism
