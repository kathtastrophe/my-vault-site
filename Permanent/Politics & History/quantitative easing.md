# Quantitative Easing

Quantitative Easing (QE) is where central banks inject financial liquidity into the economy by purchasing financial assets - usually government bonds - from commercial banks and other institutions. This increases the amount of money available within the economy, and lowers interest rates, encouraging lending and investment.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Central banks create new money.
2. This money is used to buy government bonds and financial assets from banks.
3. Banks now have an influx of cash, which they are expected to lend to businesses and consumers.
4. Lower interest rates make borrowing cheaper, increasing investment and spending.
5. This, in theory, leads to job creation and economic growth.

## Intended Effects
- Economic growth
- Prevent deflation by keeping inflation stable
- Lower interest rates

## Unintended Consequences
- Asset inflation - money is not transferred to the real economy, but instead is transferred into stocks, property and speculative investments.
- Wealth inequality - those who own assets benefit over those who rely on wages.
- Bank hoarding - banks may hoard excess cash rather than lend.

## Examples
- [[2008 financial crash]]: The U.S. Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, and Bank of England used QE to stabilize economies.
- [[COVID mirror world|COVID-19 Pandemic]] Central banks employed QE to support economies during global lockdowns.
