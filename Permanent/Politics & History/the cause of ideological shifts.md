# Ideological shifts
When people feel powerless, they are more likely to align themselves with **dominant social narratives** - especially if these narratives offer simple solutions.

For example, in WW2 groups became more open to the principles of [[eugenics]] over time due to:
- Fear of social exclusion or punishment
- Economic self-interest: believing that removing "burdens" might improve their personal situations
- Gradual desensitisation: by the time mass killings had started, people had already accepted the earlier steps.

Social norms don't tend to change all at once; instead they gradually shift, until the unthinkable becomes normal.
