# The disassociation of words from reality

>*The story beneath the story was the normalization of the disassociation between words from reality, which could only usher in the era of irony and flat detachment, because those seemed like the only self-respecting postures to adopt in a world in which everyone was lying all the time. And from there we were all primed to dive headlong into the sea of social media non sequiturs, the scroll that scrambles the narrative structures of argument and story in favor of a never-ending thought confetti of “this” and “this” and “this” and “look over there.”*
>Page 182, [[Doppelganger - Naomi Klein]]


Reactionary movements have strategically repurposed the language and posture of the oppressed, attempting to rewrite history rather than confront it. Instead of reckoning with the realities of white colonialism and genocide, they seek to return to a past that never was.

As a result, the left finds itself unable to use certain words without evoking unintended associations, leaving us struggling to articulate what is happening around us. It echoes [[Summary of Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race - Reni Eddo-Lodge|Reni Eddo-Lodge]]’s observation that progress doesn’t eliminate bigotry; instead, it drives it underground, where it festers, concealed beneath a veneer of socially acceptable language.

The importance of being able to communicate what is happening around us isn't limited to politics - we also see it's importance in [[the role of language in memory formation]].

### Blah Blah Blah

> *Build back better. Blah, blah, blah. Green economy. Blah blah blah. Net zero by 2050. Blah, blah, blah... This is all we hear from our so-called leaders. Words that sound great but so far have not led to action. Our hopes and ambitions drown in their empty promises.”*
> Greta Thunberg, [Climate Crisis Speech](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/28/blah-greta-thunberg-leaders-climate-crisis-co2-emissions)

The rhetoric of politicians is hollow and stale - their language is performative, their promises empty. Speech no longer aligns with principles and action.

The theft of progressive language and the weakened call to actions of political language both serve to diminish our ability to describe what is going on around us, heightening the uncanny and stripping us of power.
