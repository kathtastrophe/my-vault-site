# Prejudice & Morality

Humanity is predisposed to fear the unknown. Whether or not we invite or rebuke these fears relies on self-awareness and morality:

>*As for the nationalistic loves and hatreds that I have spoken of, they are part of the make-up of most of us, whether we like it or not. Whether it's possible to get rid of them I do not know, but I do believe that it is possible to struggle against them, and that is essentially a moral effort.*
