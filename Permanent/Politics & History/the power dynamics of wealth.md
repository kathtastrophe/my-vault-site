# Wealth as power

>*Imagine wandering lost in the Sahara Desert, on the verge of dying of thirst. I approach you on a camel laden with flasks of water. Suddenly, I have the power to make you ‘volunteer’ to do things on my behalf.*

Wealth functions as power through maintaining control over resources that others need or desire. When access to these scarce resources becomes conditional on transaction, a power imbalance emerges: those with wealth can compel action from those without it, not through direct coercion but through dependency. This creates a form of _structural power_, where choices appear voluntary but are shaped by material need.
