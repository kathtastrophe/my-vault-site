# The rise of conspiracy politics

Capitalism drives expansion, individualism and constant growth. Individuals living within capitalist societies are taught that they are solely responsible for themselves and their family, and if they follow the rules, work hard and climb, they will be rewarded with wealth, and therefore security.

When these rewards fail to materialise, people seek answers. If you aren't taught that capitalism is the problem, you'll turn elsewhere for answers. Those who seek to gain power have capitalised on the latter group to provide alternatives that are far more comforting than reality - a drive to return to the status quo, or the comfort of the past, where capitalism was thriving and productive, and the common man had a shot at success.

>*On either side of the reflective glass, we are not having disagreements about differing interpretations of realityâ€”we are having disagreements about who is in reality and who is in a simulation.*

### Examples

Figures like [[Steve Bannon]] and [[Naomi Wolf]] thrive in this landscape by offering simplistic, emotionally charged explanations for complex societal changes. Audiences are fed a message of urgency, of continual crisis - and are urged to take action and defend their rights. By framing themselves as truth-tellers exposing hidden agendas, they create dynamics where questioning their claims becomes proof of complicity in the very systems they rail against. This feedback loop of paranoia and distrust deepens their influence, making it difficult to break through with reasoned arguments or systemic analysis.
