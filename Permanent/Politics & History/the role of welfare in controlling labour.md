# How welfare controls labour

The welfare system provides a **morally comforting** "out" for capitalists, who can avoid employing non-standard workers, shifting costs onto governments and deepening the economic divide between those who are and are not able to work.

**Welfare is deliberately kept low** so that elites can continue to control the means of production. Without the safety net of welfare, the labour force lose options, and therefore power.
