# Resentment, weaponised

>*The less a life has in common with hers, the less she considers it a real life.*

When lower socioeconomic classes are vilified, they seek superiority wherever it is available - often by adopting prejudices that reinforce social hierarchies rather than challenging them. Resentment becomes a substitute for power when socioeconomic groups suffer from a lack of collective agency (as seen under [[Late stage capitalism|capitalism]] or [[Technofeudalism]]).

Exposure to media narratives that distort reality can deepen this alienation, redirecting frustration away from systemic injustice and toward scapegoats. Brexit, for example, was sold using messaging echoing old colonialist ideas of nationalism and sovereignty:

> *In a world with so many new threats, it's safer to control our own borders and decide for ourselves who can come into this country, not be overruled by EU judges.*

As class solidarity erodes, political identity shifts from shared struggle to individual grievance, making people susceptible to reactionary ideologies that promise belonging through exclusion.
