# Winner vs Loser mentality

>*A nationalist is one who thinks solely , or mainly , in terms of competitive prestige . He may be a positive or a negative nationalist – that is , he may use his mental energy either in boosting or in denigrating – but at any rate his thoughts always turn on victories , defeats , triumphs and humiliations . He sees history , especially contemporary history , as the endless rise and decline of great power units , and every event that happens seems to him a demonstration that his own side is on the up - grade and some hated rival is on the down - grade .*

Nationalists don't perceive the world in terms of morality, but instead view progress through the lens of competition.

This lens can become a kaleidoscope, distorting history to suit their narratives: events in contemporary history are often seen as proof of their victory, regardless of the event's actual cause or its relevance to their own interests.
