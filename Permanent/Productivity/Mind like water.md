# Mind like water

A concept from [[GTD|Getting Things Done by David Allen]], referring to a mental state of clarity and calm, where responses are proportionate to demands.

This state can be achieved by externalising tasks, organising effectively, and trusting your system.

This state promotes adaptability and focus, and reduces overwhelm.
