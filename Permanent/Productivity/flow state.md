# Flow state

Flow state is a state of immersion in a task, often leading to **peak performance**. The term was coined by psychologist **Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi**.

Flow state can be achieved when the **skill level matches the challenge** of the task. Achieving this state also requires **clear goals, immediate feedback, and the elimination of distractions**. 

When flow state is achieved, task completion feels **effortless and enjoyable**.

Flow state aligns with the concept of [[Mind like water|mind like water]], as both involve **reducing mental clutter to maintain focus**.
