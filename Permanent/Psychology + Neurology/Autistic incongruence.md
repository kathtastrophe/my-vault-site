# Autistic incongruence

**Incongruence** refers to a misalignment of emotion and outward expression.

Autistic people are in tune with the emotional tone in an environment, but due to [[alexithymia]], may not be able to understand why that tone has changed.

This can lead autistic people to internalise emotional shifts that they can't interpret, leading to incongruence.
