# What causes Parkinson's?

Parkinson's develops when the nerve cells responsible for **dopamine** production stop working, creating a [[dopamine deficiency]].

The cause of the loss of these nerve cells is unknown, but may be due to a combination of **age**, **genetic** and **environmental** factors.

As [[parkinson's]] develops, more of these nerve cells will become damaged, worsening the dopamine deficit.

This causes the symptoms of [[parkinson's]] to gradually **worsen over time**.

#### Is it hereditary?

Parkinson's is not usually hereditary, although certain **heritable gene mutations** are thought to contribute to its development.

#### Environmental factors

There is some evidence to support the theory that **environmental factors**, such as exposure to herbicides and pesticides may contribute to the development of [[parkinson's]].
