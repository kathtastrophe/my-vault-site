# Why does confirmation bias happen?

- **Information overload** - Humans process so much information, so often rely on ==instinct== to prevent ==overarousal and decision fatigue==.
- **[[Self worth]]** - When people find out that a belief they value is wrong, they can ==feel badly about themselves==.
- **Wanting to be right** - Finding out you are wrong about something may need to deeper ==questioning== of your ==overall intelligence==.
