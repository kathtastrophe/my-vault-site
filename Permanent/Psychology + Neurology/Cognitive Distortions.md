# Cognitive Distortions

Cognitive distortions refers to patterns of unhelpful or biased thinking that negatively affect out perception of the world around us.

These thought patterns are often automatic and can lead to distorted views of the world, contributing to stress, anxiety and depression.

Types of cognitive distortions can be:
#### Filtering
👎 Only focussing on the negative, ignoring the positive
- =="I hate Croydon - there's nowhere to walk to, I don't feel safe in the park"==
#### Catastrophising
💣 Expecting the worst case scenario
- =="It will never be a stress free time. That's just what life is. Why can't I find a way to cope?"==

#### Polarised thinking
♟ Seeing things in black and white - all or nothing thinking, ignoring the positives

#### Heaven's reward fallacy
👼 Expecting self sacrifice to be rewarded

#### Control fallacies
👩‍🦰 Assumes only others to blame, or assumes only self to blame

#### Always being right
☑ Being right is paramount. Being wrong is unacceptable
- ==Not very "me"==

#### Fallacy of fairness
⚖ Assumes life should be fair
- ==I'm still feeling shitty today. It's not fair.==

#### Personalisation
🙋‍♀️ Always assuming self responsible
- ==Always saying "sorry" automatically==

#### Overgeneralisation
📏 Assumes a rule from one experience
- ==I always remember how I feel when I'm there - like I'm back in school. It's not them, it's me. I get so shy."==
