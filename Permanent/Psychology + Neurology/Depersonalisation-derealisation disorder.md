# Depersonalisation-derealisation disorder

Depersonalisation is when you feel you feel outside of yourself - for example, observing yourself performing activities from a distance.

Derealisation is where you feel the world around you is unreal. The world around you may feel foggy and distant.

You can have depersonalisation or derealisation, or they can occur at the same time.
