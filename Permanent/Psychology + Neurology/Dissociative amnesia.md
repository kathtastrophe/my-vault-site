# Dissociative amnesia

Dissociative amnesia is when a person forgets details related to their life - including events, time periods, or personal information. The person may be aware or unaware of their memory loss.

It can arise as a result of trauma or stress.

Dissociative disorder can resolve over time with psychiatric intervention, but it may last for the duration of an individual's life.
