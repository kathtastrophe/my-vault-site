# Dissociative identity disorder

Dissociative identity disorder used to be referred to as multiple personality disorder.

It manifests through an individual's identity fragmenting into different personality states. This can be a split of two or more.

People with this condition often experienced trauma or abuse.

A person with this disorder may feel the presence of other personalities and be confused about their identity.
