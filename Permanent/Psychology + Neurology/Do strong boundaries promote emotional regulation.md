# Do strong boundaries promote emotional regulation?

Strong boundaries should promote and reinforce [[Emotional Regulation]].

Managing emotions effectively requires balance and sufficient energy. Chronic stress, for instance, can disrupt this process by depleting the resources needed for self-regulation.

Establishing and maintaining firm boundaries creates space to restore energy levels and reduce stress. This, in turn, supports better emotional balance and resilience.
