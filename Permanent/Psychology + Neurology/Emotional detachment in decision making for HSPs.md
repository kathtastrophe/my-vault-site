# Emotional detachment in decision making for HSPs

If humans are better at approaching decisions when there is no emotional attachment, then **detachment becomes the desired state**.

This is particularly true if the emotion attached to a decision stems from past experiences, as emotions aren't logical and be unhelpful if erroneously attached to a decision.

It may be possible to achieve emotional detachment through [[transcendental meditation]] or increased [[Self Acceptance|self acceptance]].
