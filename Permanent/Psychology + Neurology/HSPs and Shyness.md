# HSPs and shyness

Not all HSPs are inherently shy, but shyness can be experienced by HSPs.

By labelling HSPs as shy, shyness can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Overarousal in HSPs can be misinterpreted as shyness.

## Overcoming Shyness

By understanding the **root cause** of shyness including potential triggers, HSPs can employ strategies to better navigate social situations:

- Recognise the **difference between overarousal and fear.**
	- This allows for more practical handling of overarousal, helping to manage emotional reactions.
- **Share experiences** with other HSPs.
- Use **arousal reducing techniques**. *See [[Reclaiming energy]]*
- Develop a **"persona"** - for example, using predictable methods to generate safe conversation
- **Communicate** your sensitivity when it is safe to do so.
