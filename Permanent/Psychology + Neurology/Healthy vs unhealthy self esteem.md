# Your self esteem can be healthy or unhealthy.

- Having healthy self esteem helps you to recognise your strengths.
- Having unhealthy self esteem makes it difficult to recognise your strengths.
- [[Confirmation bias]] can reinforce unhealthy self esteem, creating a vicious cycle.
- Low self esteem can also lead to risk avoidance, which inhibits the individual from personal growth, in turn perpetuating low self esteem.
- Big events, such as losing a job or getting married, can effect self esteem.
