# Hyperfocus

Hyperfocus refers to fixed attention to a single task or project for a long time.

It's common in [[ADHD]].

> *“Children and adults with ADHD have difficulty shifting attention from one thing to another. If they’re doing something they enjoy or find psychologically rewarding, they’ll tend to persist in this behavior after others would normally move on to other things. The brains of people with ADHD are drawn to activities that give instant feedback.”*
> Russell Barkley, PHD

Hyperfocus is a neutral, not a negative. There are benefits and drawbacks of hyperfocus - it can be useful if applied to a productive task, but it isn't useful if it causes damage to relationships or loss of productivity.
