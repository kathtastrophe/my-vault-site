# Interoception

Interoception is the ability to sense and perceive internal bodily signals, such as hunger, thirst, heart rate, pain, or temperature.

It helps individuals understand their emotional and physical states and how they respond to them.

Interoception plays a significant role in [[emotional regulation]], as it connects physical sensations to emotional experiences.

It may also affects self-awareness, and the ability to make decisions based on bodily states.

Interoceptive ability may be heightened or impaired in conditions like depression, anxiety, autism, and chronic pain disorders.
