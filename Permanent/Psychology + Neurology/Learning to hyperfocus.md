# Learning to hyperfocus

The ability to hyperfocus can be innate or learned.

Neurodivergent individuals often have a neurological predisposition toward hyperfocussing, owing to impaired dopamine regulation. *See [[dopamine deficiency]]*

For neurotypicals, hyperfocus can sometimes be achieved when engaging in a task that you are deeply interested in, as well as through minimising external distractions.

With practice, it can be enhanced and employed as a skill.
