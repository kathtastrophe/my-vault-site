# Low self worth

If your [[Inner critic|inner critic]] isn't managed effectively, it's difficult to build self worth.

In other words, if we only listen to negative self-talk with no intervention, we may start to believe it.

Without self compassion, we rely on external factors to determine self worth. But these external factors are in constant flux, so they're not a useful measure for self evaluation. *See [[Self esteem|self esteem]].*
