# How does confirmation bias manifest?

- If information conflicts with a decision that has been made, a person may ignore it to ==avoid discomfort==.
- People are generally not motivated to try and change their beliefs, because their beliefs feed into their measurement of [[Self worth|self worth]].
- People tend to seek ==positive evidence== to support a claim, meaning a claim is likely to be supported rather than critiqued.
- ==First impressions== may also be subject to confirmation bias. For example, if you are told a person is warm and friendly, you'll be more likely to perceive them this way.
