# Masking

Masking refers to suppressing or altering natural behaviours to confirm to **social expectations**.

Masking is a particularly common practice for **neurodivergent** individuals, and is often employed to minimise external judgement for social differences.

Neurotypical people may also mask as a way of **avoiding judgement or negative attention**.

Masking for long periods of time can lead to **exhaustion**, **stress**, and a diminished sense of **identity**.
