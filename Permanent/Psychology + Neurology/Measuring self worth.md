# Measuring self worth

The factors that determine an individual's measurement of their self worth vary based on how they prioritise their values. *See [[Areas of human competition|areas of competition]].*

To measure self worth consider:
- Engagement with negative self talk. *See [[Inner critic|inner critic]]*
- Boundary setting ability
- If a fear of failure exists.

An individual continually experiencing difficulties in these areas may have [[Low self worth|low self worth]]. Excelling in these areas indicates [[High self worth|high self worth]].
