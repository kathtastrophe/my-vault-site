# Misconceptions About Self acceptance

#### Self-acceptance is not the same as conceding defeat.

ðŸ’¡ Once you've fully accepted your circumstances, you can start to work towards positive change.

#### Without self-acceptance, emotions can be repressed.

ðŸ˜¥ This can lead to long-term mental health problems or addiction issues.

#### It is possible to have high self-esteem and low self-acceptance.

For example, you may believe others see you as capable, but due to risk avoidance, this has never been reinforced.
