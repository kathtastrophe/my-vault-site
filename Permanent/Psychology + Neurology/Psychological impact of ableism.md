# Mental impact of ableism

>*Morris said the language used by government ministers since the welfare cut plans were leaked last week has been hurtful. “I think it’s been an incredibly difficult time... Regardless of what actually gets announced, it’s the way that it’s being spun – ==I’m being made as a disabled person to feel like a burden.==”*

**Ableism**, as seen here in Labour's 2025 welfare cuts, creates the narrative that disabled people are burdens to society. Intertwined with the prominence of [[Wellness under capitalism|wellness culture]], the dominant narrative is that sickness and disability are the result of personal failing. It becomes very difficult for disabled people not to internalise this messaging, especially when they are ostracised from an able-centric society. The world is often hostile to disabled people, both socially and physically, leading to isolation and loneliness.

- **Mental health conditions** (depression, anxiety) are far more likely to co-exist with disabilities, largely due to the way in which wider society perceives those with disabilities.
- **Suicide rates** in those with disabilities is around 3 times higher compared to the general population.
