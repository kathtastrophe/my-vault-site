# Radical authenticity 

**Radical Authenticity** refers to the practice of being **completely socially honest**, openly expressing your thoughts, feelings, and intentions.

> _"When there’s a disconnect, calling it out can help the other person trust their intuition. Framing the breakdown through a lens of neurodiverse communication can prevent them from internalizing it as their own fault."_  
> – Dr. Megan Anna Neff

Practicing [[Self Acceptance|self-acceptance]] supports radical authenticity by fostering confidence in your true self and reducing the fear of judgment or rejection.
