# The fragility of identity

Our identities are fragile. Are we defined by how we see ourselves, or how others perceive us? What happens when others begin to see someone else as us - who are we then?

When we're confused for someone else, it can trigger feelings of humiliation, as it highlights our own interchangeability and vulnerability. Nobody wants to be forgettable, but in truth we are all forgettable. Our ideas and values cease to be curated by us once they are easily accessed by others.

In spite of our best efforts to shape our personal lives and public personas, our sense of self remains vulnerable to forces outside of our control. (*See [[The vulnerability of shock]]*.)

We may attempt to perform a perfected version of ourselves, but what happens to the parts we reject or abandon? Those "unwanted selves" may lie dormant, but their absence leaves us vulnerable to instability, as the self is never as stable or inherent as we wish it to be.
