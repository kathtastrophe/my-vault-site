# A brief history of autism
### Red Vienna

In [[Red Vienna]] , neurodivergence was viewed as "a different way of being human" and developed tailored support for neurodivergent individuals. This approach emphasised acceptance and accommodation.

### Nazi Reversal

During the Nazi era, the programs established under Red Vienna to support neurodivergent individuals were co-opted to identify individuals who weren't deemed as worthy as life. This led to the systematic euthanasia of disabled individuals, framed as a way to eliminate those seen as a burden on the state.
