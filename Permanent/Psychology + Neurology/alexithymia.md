# Alexithymia

Alexithymia refers to difficulty with identifying, describing and processing emotions.

An individual with alexithymia may struggle to **vocalise** their feelings, and may prefer to focus on **external** events rather than **internal** feelings.

> *"Just because I struggle to put how I feel into words it doesn't mean I don't feel things. In fact, the worse I feel, the more I struggle and often default to, 'I'm fine'."*

Alexithymia often co-occurs alongside mental health conditions such as [[anxiety]], [[depression]] and [[PTSD]]. It is also common among [[autism|autistic]] individuals.
