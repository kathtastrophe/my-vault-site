# The "golden ball of light" visualisation technique

Imagine you have a golden ball of light in your chest. This is your energy.

The light has many golden threads attached to it.

These threads are linked to all of the people, events, and feelings that are concerning you or leading you to feel overwhelmed.

Practice [[4-7-8 breathing]].

As you are breathing, imagine the golden threads unhooking from the source of your worries.

As you do this, you notice the golden ball expanding, becoming brighter and more luminous.

Your energy is returning to you. As the golden ball expands, you feel a return to yourself.

You're detaching from the events and emotions of the day, so that you can care for yourself.
