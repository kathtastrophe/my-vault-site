# How is interoception measured?

One way of measuring interoception is to have the subject close their eyes and count their own heartbeat for a length of time. Their count is compared to the actual number of heartbeats in order to measure their bodily awareness.

Self-scoring questionnaires can also be used.

## Increasing interoception

Practicing heart beat recognition can increase interoceptive ability.

Regular physical exercise, including both aerobic and strength training, can improve interoception by making the body more resilient and better equipped to handle physical and emotional challenges.
