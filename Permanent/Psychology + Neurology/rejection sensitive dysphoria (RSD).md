This is most commonly associated with [[ADHD]], but can occur in other conditions, such as mood disorders or [[PTSD]], and in individuals with [[Highly Sensitive Person (HSP)|heightened emotional sensitivity]].

Symptoms include extreme feelings of shame, anger, or anxiety, often disproportionate to the situation. It can lead to perfectionism, avoidance of potential rejection, or intense self-criticism.

RSD can be managed through therapy, [[Emotional Regulation|emotional regulation]] strategies and self-awareness techniques.
