# Social model of disability

The medical model of disability views disability as an individual problem that can be "fixed" through treatment, rather than addressing societal barriers.

The social model of disability is the idea that disability should not be viewed as inherent, but as a way of defining the mismatch between needs and environment.

This model examines the societal context that frames "differences" as disabilities. For example, traits like distractibility in [[ADHD]] may be seen as impairments in productivity-focused societies but could have been beneficial in hunter-gatherer environments, where rapid attention shifts were advantageous.

## Benefits

**Empowerment**
If disability is a social construct, then making societal changes to support inclusivity and accessibility can easily remove barriers.

**Autonomy**
Having the choice to identify as disabled gives individuals control over how they define their experiences, rather than being ascribed a label. This autonomy allows people to navigate their identity in a way that aligns with their needs and lived reality.

## Drawbacks

**Not just external factors**
In those who have "differences" or "deficits", challenges may persist even when stripped of context. This model risks minimising individual struggles by overemphasising external factors.
