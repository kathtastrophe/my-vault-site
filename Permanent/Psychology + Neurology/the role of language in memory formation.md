# Language & memory formation

We don't usually have memories from before the age of 2 or 3, and it's thought that this is because prior to this age, we lack the linguistic ability to properly describe what's going on around us:

>_We need the anatomical structures and circuitry of language to tell the story of what happened, to organize the details of our experiences into a coherent narrative that can then be revisited and shared later._
 Page 86 â€“ [[Summary of Remember: The science of memory and the art of forgetting (Lisa Genova)]]

Forming narratives relies on the ability to effectively communicate - one cannot exist without the other.
