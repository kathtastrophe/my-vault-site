# Transcendental meditation (TM)

Transcendental meditation (TM) is a meditation technique derived from Buddhism, where a **personal mantra** is repeated to achieve a state of **deep relaxation and awareness**.

This is typically practiced for 20 minutes, twice a day, whist sitting comfortably with eyes close.

Reported benefits include stress reduction, increased focus, and improved emotional wellbeing.

TM is distinct from mindfulness meditation as the emphasis is on **repetition rather than focused attention**.

### Note
==Some online communities suggest a TM mantra can only be obtained through seeking paid TM training from a qualified TM teacher. I'm unclear on the validity of this.==
