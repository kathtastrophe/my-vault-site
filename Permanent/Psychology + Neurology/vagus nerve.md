# The Vagus nerve

**What it is**:  
The vagus nerve is a long nerve in your body that connects your brain to various organs, including your heart, lungs, and digestive system.

**What it does**:
- It helps control things you don’t consciously think about, like your heart rate and breathing.
- It also plays a big role in digestion, helping your body process food.
- It’s part of the "rest and digest" system, meaning it helps calm your body down after stress.

**Why it’s important**:
- It can help lower your heart rate and blood pressure.
- It’s linked to your mood and emotional health, so having a healthy vagus nerve is good for feeling relaxed and calm.

## How To Activate:
- **Breathing deeply** – Taking slow, deep breaths can stimulate the vagus nerve.
- **Cold exposure** – Splashing cold water on your face or a cold shower can activate it.
- **Humming or singing** – These can also stimulate the vagus nerve.
- **Yoga or meditation** – Practices that promote relaxation help activate it too.
